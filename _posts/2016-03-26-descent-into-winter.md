# Descent into Winter

The first quarter of 2016 has come and gone already. The summer heat is a memory and now the days are a very comfortable mid-20 degrees. Our crawler is now fully a toddler, and getting into anything if she has the chance.

The garden is having an easier time of it. The combination of blistering sun and oppressive heat, meant anything I tried to grow just withered for the most part. And if that didn't kill them off, the few seedlings I tried transplanting were all eaten by birds. Doesn't help that the soil here is absolutely rubbish. But I've started composting and am hoping to encourage some earthworms back into the garden if at all possible. I've no idea if there are any in the neighbourhood. You don't have to dig very far down to get to what seems like an inpenetrable clay layer.
So far, the most gardening success I've had, has been in pots.
