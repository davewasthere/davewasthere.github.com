# 2012 - The latter half

## Dubai
Jammed another upgrade to Business which was very nice, as I was still feeling rather delicate after my food poisoning in Vietnam. Actually, my only other food poisoning got me a Business class upgrade too. Maybe there's a pattern?

Was only there for the one day, but managed to catch up with the Dubai crew: Will, Jac, Yousef, Meredith & Martin. As well as have another scrummy meal at one of my favourite restaurants on Al Murraqqabat road.

## Piston Broke
I was going to let this one slide, as I had a motorbike trip the next day, but mates at UCAS didn't let me get away with it. So my 40th was a nice evening at the Swan pub doing a quiz night and a ton of friends dropping by to wish me well. Was a lovely evening and I was feeling well set for the next morning's journey.

Met Todd & Jim at a petrol station on the M4 and we met up with D at Folkstone.
