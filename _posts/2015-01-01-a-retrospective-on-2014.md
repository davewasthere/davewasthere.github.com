It can be hard writing these things retrospectively. Mostly I cherry-pick a few photos that aren't completely awful and write a few words around them. While it might be better to just keep up with them a little more regularly, I'd kind of lost interest in blogging for a while.

## It starts off back in NZ

As is family tradition, we all head to Auckers for a Dotty Birthday get-together. Love seeing my cousins and all the Aunties & Uncles. We're not a big family, but it's still pretty special to manage to get us all in once place at the same time.

After Grandma's birthday, I did my traditional hammer around the North Island visiting relatives. Spent time in Tauranga with my cousin's family. Tauranga is somewhere I'd love to move to one day. It's a nice size (about 100k population), has great beaches and a decent climate (although a very wet winter) and isn't _that_ far from Auckland if you do need the big smoke for some reason...

Also went to Morrinsville and spent a bit of time with rallies there. Mostly either playing golf with my Uncle, or doing night photography and just generally chilling with my cousin.

Then headed down the line to Wellington. Got out for a sail on a mate's boat which is always fun even when the weather was a bit rough. Spent a bit of time down there with Auntie Joan before heading back up to Auckers.

## Investigating Raro

While in NZ, a couple of friends had suggested I hook up with [Solar Bob](http://solarbob.net/) in Raro. With my Engineering background, and the Cook Islands government pushing to get the islands to 100% renewable energy by 2020, there's the possibilty of getting involved in solar projects.

So I booked my tickets to Raro to check it out. I'd managed to get a reasonable deal on accommodation, as prices in Raro are pretty expensive. Got to the island, rented a bike and started checking the place out.

Bob is a top bloke and showed me around some of the solar installations on Raro, including Muri Beach Resort who've done an incredible job with their solar system going completely off-grid. One of the challenges facing the island is storage of renewables. Until electrolytic flow batteries enter the mainstream, they're probably likely to still need to generate power using diesel (which is how they generate most of their power now) to cover gaps when renewable generation doesn't supply enough energy.

I also managed to explore the island a bit. There's just one main road around the island, that's about 32km long. There's also an inner road, but it doesn't appear to go the entire way around, covering perhaps two thirds of the island's circumference. You can get either the clockwise or anti-clockwise bus, but one of the benefits of renting a scooter is the ability to go off-piste a bit. I made the most of it. 

One of the most amazing sights to me, was the abandoned Sheraton Resort on the southern part of the island. It was 80% completed when the backers and insurers all pulled out after it'd gone massively overbudget and corruption was exposed (Mafia links and money paid for work that was never completed). But one of the cool tidbits is how the land was _'cursed'_ since 1911 after More Uriatua was shot and killed following an argument about the land's ownership. Then, when the Hotel project began, the grandson turns up in warlike regalia, reaffirming the curse and with a spear, split the rock that held the plaque that'd just be unveiled by the Prime Minister. Cool story bro!

## In search of a sail
