<p><br>Hey everyone. This is my first travelogue update from the big
wide world. This one comes from Chita. A small city in Russia.<br><br>Why am I here? Well, it's a bit of a long story. But basically I
got detained for three days at the Russian border post of
Zabaikalsk. They did not like the look of my passport. Mine was
issued in 1991 and they only have the description for the newer
style. Eventually the big kahuna there decided I was a nice
looking boy, and could continue on my way. Unfortunately this
means I am having to make my way across mother Russia with only
my limited Russian knowledge and a bit of pantomime.<br><br>Who said this wasn't going to be exciting?<br><br>So I'm having a very big adventure. My aim at the moment, is to
get to Irkutsk by train (I've just bought a ticket, but the train
doesn't leave until tomorrow sometime.) Then to Moscow in time to
catch my 9th June flight to London. (it's also when my visa runs
out. DOH!)<br><br>Mike &amp; Brenda, if you get this before I catch up, then
everything is okay. I didn't get sent back to China. Instead I
got locked in a cell for three days. :)<br><br>I don't quite know what the deal was, but I think the border
guards (frontier forces) as they called themselves, wanted me to
take a Russian wife. I was a bit freaked out for a couple of days.
I almost missed my train out of Zabaikalsk as well. It left from
behind the station. Here I am out the front going &quot; boy the
train must be here soon. It's meant to leave in 2 minutes...&quot;
Duh!<br><br>Hong Kong was okay. Huge in the electronics market, but not really
a lot cheaper. And no, I didn't manage to pick up a copy of Star Wars first episode while I was there. (only on VCD anyway)<br><br>Beijing was pretty choice. The only real tourist thing I did was
the Forbidden City. Tiannemen (whatever) square was being rebuilt.
I think it's a cunning plan to remove any focus for the tenth
anniversary of the Tiannamen square massacre (june 6th 1989) as
the excuse given is the renovations are for the 50th anniversary
of the Peoples republic.<br>The rest of the time I cycled around Beijing (huge!) and chatted
to people with my (yet again) limited vocabulary.<br><br>Had a small scare when leaving Beijing. I had bought a small
knife to get rid of a <strong>VERY</strong> persistent street hawker (10$NZD)
and it was detected in the xray machine. It got confiscated
possibly because one of the guards wanted it. But when I got onto
the train, there was an American with these two huge samurai-type
swords. Go figure...<br><br>Another kiwi lady had some fun at Zabaikalsk too. She changed her
Chinese Yuan to Russian Roubles, but one 10Y (NZD$3.00?) note was
a suspected forgery. So she was held for a couple of hours. At
least she managed to catch her train though...<br><br>That's probably enough for now. I'll try and keep a few progress
reports going. Especially between now and London, but it's not
easy to find Internet access in Russia. (Can't even find non-carbonated
water. &#39;Nyet bubbles&#39; doesn&#39;t seem to work.)<br><br>Looking forward to spend a day or two in Irkutsk before catching
a plan to Moscow. Still haven't contacted either NZ Embassy in
Moscow to see if they will update passport descriptions at
Zabaikalsk and travel Insurance in NZ to see if they will pay for
the extra expense. (cheap enough though.)<br><br>Spot ya-all later.</p>
