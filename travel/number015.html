<h2>The second half of 2004 (almost)</h2>

<p>I think my last update only covered 2004 until June. So there's still a fair 
bit to catch up on. But life keeps getting in the way. I'm thinking I should try and
    break these buggers down into smaller, more manageable chunks.</p>

<h3>God I miss Weet-Bix</h3>

<p>It's funny how the little things from home are the things you miss the most. 
As a kid I lived on weet-bix. (Either with milk and sugar or with peanut butter 
or marmite as a spread) And they've got something vaguely similar over here too. 
You tend to re-brand any time you live in another country, but Weetabix/Weet-Bix... 
not much difference you'd think. Both are a whole grain cereal biscuit-type 
affair...</p>

<p>...But no - you'd be wrong. As wrong as it was ever possible to be. 
Sanitarium <a href="http://www.weetbix.co.nz/">Weet-Bix</a> from NZ (not sure 
about Aus or South Africa) is a delicious golden crunchy biscuit, whereas
<a href="http://www.weetabix.co.uk/">Weetabix</a> from the UK (for all that the 
name is similar) is actually just unappealing recycled paper briquettes.</p>

    <strong>A line-up of the different cereals</strong><p>
You can also buy something called Sunny-Bisk, which is 'supposed' to be the same 
as Weet-Bix in NZ, Aus and South Africa. But again, it falls a bit short when 
you compare it to Weet-Bix brought from home.</p>

<h3>A smattering of snow</h3>

<p>
<img border="0" src="images015/thumbnails/DSC00121.jpg" width="150" height="100"></p>

<p>
We had some great weather at the start of the year, as you can see. It doesn't 
often snow in Cheltenham, but I do like it - for novelty value - at least for 
the first few hours... After the first day though, most of the snow turns into a thin layer
    of packed ice, which doesn't melt for the next couple of days. Helps to make the walk to work just that little bit more interesting.</p>

<h3>Sat and Rachel's Wedding</h3>

<p>
<img border="0" src="images015/thumbnails/DSC00209.jpg" width="107" height="100"></p>

<p>
My last update I'd written about Sat's stag weekend, which was a great laugh. 
Well, the wedding was pretty awesome too. It was held at the Barbican, which was a really
    great venue.
</p>
    <p>
        The hilight of the reception for me was wearing the Indian Bindi (little jewelery
        on your forehead) and shuffling tables to go sit with Manjit, his lovely wife and
        son and Bob. The food was pretty fantastic too.</p>

<h3>Transit of Venus</h3>

<p>
<img border="0" src="images015/thumbnails/DSC00386.jpg" width="100" height="100">I
    had some great fun with the transit of venus. I rigged up a solar filter and a makeshift
    telescope so I could videotape the transit. The quality was pretty poor, but not
    that bad when you consider how bad my setup was.</p>
    <p>
        Still bloody amazing to imagine that is a plant in-between us and the sun. And that
        it's commonplace for most people to be informed about such events these days. It
        gives me new-found respect for the astronomers of yesterday; Halley, Galilei, Ptolemy,
        Copernicus et al.</p>

<h2>West coast USA</h2>

<h3>Vegas</h3>

<p>
<img border="0" src="images015/thumbnails/DSC00399.jpg" width="150" height="100">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        Perhaps
    it was a little stupid, but straight after
    we landed, our plan was to drive straight
    to Vegas. After a 14 hour flight, this isn't actually that good an idea. About half
    way to Nevada I really ran out of energy and just had to have a kip for an hour
    or two. Still didn't feel rested after the kip, but Liezl was impatient to get to
    Vegas and it was getting pretty late.</p>
    <p>
        Great place to spend some time in though. I'm not into the gambling scene, but I
        did throw a quarter into one of the slot machines (just so I could say that I had).</p>
    <p>
        Managed to catch up with Simmo. He hasn't changed (apart from the Wife, respectable
        job and long dreadlocks).</p>
    <p>
        Did the typical wander up and down the strip, but spent most of the time in the
        suburbs visiting friends. I met some great people there.</p>
    <p>
        Shopping was fantastic. America is all about the Malls. I'm not the best shopper,
        but even I started to get into the shopping scene here. (Helps when you are on holiday
        too)</p>

<h3>San Diego</h3>


<img border="0" src="images015/thumbnails/DSC00425.jpg" width="92" height="100"><p>After
    Vegas, San Diego was a nice bit of reality. It's a very pretty place. I could live
    there quite comfortably. <a href="http://www.benihana.com">Benihana</a> was a good
    start. Fantastic Japanese style seafood. Cooked in front of us on a hotplate. In
    fact most of this trip was about food. The portions were huge, but oh so yummy!</p>
    <p>
        The city itself reminded me of Wellington. Not stupidly spread out like Auckland.
        The weather wasn't particularly good though. One waitress called it the June-Gloom.</p>

<h3>Los Angeles</h3>
<img border="0" src="images015/thumbnails/DSC00472.jpg" width="150" height="100"><p>I
    don't know what to say about LA. It's massive. It's great to see so many places
    that you can recognise from the movies. Again, we didn't really spend much time
    doing the typical touristy stuff. Mostly we just ate food and hung around with friends.</p>
    <p>
        Surprisingly though, America isn't populated solely with fat people. I mean, it
        sort of has that reputation in other parts of the world, but I guess that is more
        applicable to states like Texas. Californians tend to be the beautiful people, concerned
        with looking good, staying fit and slim. And it was nice to see. That still didn't
        stop us from going to house of pancakes though. Even where we were staying in Long
        Beach, there were 3 donut shops within 400 metres of each other. Crazy!</p>
    <p>
        The most painful thing was leaving on the last day. American Airlines really couldn't
        organise a piss-up in a brewery. We were delayed due to some maintenance work needed
        on the landing gear, then we had to dump fuel immediately after takeoff so we could
        land again when whatever it was happened again (wouldn't lock in the up position
        perhaps?). Then we hung around the airport until they decided that the plane wouldn't
        be ready that day. Then we had to queue to get hotel and food vouchers. By the time
        we got dropped off at the hotel, the hotel restaurant had closed, so we ended up
        walking to a nearby all-night restaurant. (we were told to take a taxi instead of
        walk the 400m... not sure why tbh)</p>
    <p>
        I'm sure it was nice to get home though. I just don't understand why...</p>

<h3>Dodgy Advertising in UK</h3>


<img border="0" src="images015/thumbnails/DSC00689.jpg" width="75" height="100"><p>I
    was pretty surprised to see this photo in a vodafone store on the way home. Maybe
    I have a filthy mind or something, but I've got to wonder what they were thinking
    of when they approved this one.</p>

<h3>I.S. Christmas Party</h3>

<p>
<img border="0" src="images015/thumbnails/DSC00706.jpg" width="150" height="100">
<img border="0" src="images015/thumbnails/DSC00716.jpg" width="67" height="100"></p>
    <p>
        We had a great Christmas party. The terrible threesome came in drag (again). What
        is it with those guys and dresses? It was a cowboy dress-up theme with your standard
        casino night, electric bull ride and not a small amount of alchohol. Unfortunately
        for the Banbury crowd, it sounds like their bus driver smoked a bit too much crack.
        After getting the bus stuck in mud before even making it away from the venue he
        then managed to get incredibly lost that it took several hours to get back to Banbury.
        (should've taken more like 40 minutes.)</p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        I know this update is really random and disjointed, but I just had to get it finished.
        Next one will have our Philippines trip and my racing competition in Madrid.</p>
    <p>
        Ciao</p>
