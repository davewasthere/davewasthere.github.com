<p>Well. I'm now in London. Mike
and Brenda have headed off to Greece for a couple of weeks, and I'm
looking around for accommodation and work.</p>
<p>Moscow was pretty mind blowing.
After leaving the very nice people at the embassy I went for a
bit of a cruise around town. Basically, over the next couple of
days I did the walking tour of Moscow. It's enormous! The only
real problem with walking is the intersections. Most of the time
there are subways for pedestrians. But on the smaller ones, you
have to cross the road. And with every bugger driving on the
right-hand side, all of my instincts are wrong. I ALWAYS look the
wrong way before crossing. It's a bit of a pain, but I've
survived so far...</p>
<p>Checked out the dead-dude
himself at Lenin's Mausoleum. Freaky. It's kind of surreal to go
through there. So many guards watching as an endless stream of
people shuffle around a delicately floodlit corpse. You are not
allowed to stop as we found out. The guards don't blow a whistle
at you (like they do in the rest of the Kremlin) instead they
whack a fist into their palm. Makes a decent sounding noise
though, because everyone is being silent.</p>
<p>The first day of walking
happened to also be the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin's
anniversary (of what I didn't figure out) and there were heaps of
celebrating and festivals and events on around the Kremlin. For
the first half of the day I thought it was the normal amount of
people. Just madness!</p>
<p><img height="245" src="images003/pozharsky.jpg" width="293"><br><strong>Minin and Pozharsky memorial next to Red square</strong></p>
<p>While I really enjoy the tourist
attractions around the place, I get more out of just wandering
around and striking up little conversations with the people
around there. I still went to places like the armoury in the
Kremlin (take fast film 800-1600) but it is not as good as having
a little chat in a Russian-English mix to a kebab dealer (I was
hanging out for one) on the street.</p>

speed slide film. TAKE FAST
FILM.</p>
<p>The nights were pretty hot, and&nbsp;there
was no air conditioning in the hotel room. Luckily I was able to
open up the windows to get a bit of a breeze going through. Since
I was on the 13th floor, and I had the windows open, I figured it
was a good time to make some paper darts. Boy do they go!</p>
<p>Almost got killed, twice, on the
way out to the Airport. Full credit to the taxi driver though. It
was not his fault at all. In fact, he was the first taxi driver I've
used in the last couple of weeks that wasn't trying to kill me.
Needless to say, we made it to the airport alive. I made it
through customs (Yay!) and our flight left for London.</p>
<p>So now I'm in London. I've
basically just settled into the swing of things here. It has
taken me a couple of days to realise that I am actually here. But
I think I've accepted it. I've started looking around for a job.
All I did was send my CV to one agency and I had three guys ring
me up for interviews. It sounds positive, and I don't think it
will take to long to find somewhere decent.</p>
<p>I've been staying with a friend
Arran and his girlfriend Ariane in Notting hill. (yes, like the
movie) Arran &amp; I have known each other since we were about 9.
Ever since we moved to Titirangi.</p>
<p>Arran's mum, Cathy, came over
from New Zealand. She had a neat little toy with her. One of
those Sony Mavica digital cameras. It records pictures straight
onto floppy disk. I was even able to take reasonable copies of my
slides with it (see pozharsky and armoury pictures). Is it cool
fun or what. Here is a gif that Arran and I worked on yesterday.</p>

<p>Went out to a party on Saturday
(I turned 27 - arrgghh!). Another Kiwi had the same birthday as
me, and it turned out to be quite a good bash. There were a few
DJs there with turntables and heaps of really awesome music.
Ended up dancing until 4am, at which point it started getting
light, the birds started chirping, and we were all naffed.</p>
<p>The only downer about the whole
night were the two South-Africans there. I can't remember meeting
any before, but these two guys spouting the most racist garbage I've
ever been unfortunate enough to hear. Took me a whole minute
before I decided I had to leave the room. I've been assured that
most aren't like that though.</p>
<p>Watched the cricket final the
next day. What an utter thrashing. 'Nuff said about that.</p>
<p>Hope everyone is doing well back
in NZ. I'll write again once I'm a bit more settled, or if I
decide to bugger off and keep travelling for a&nbsp;while. I know
it's sick, but after a couple of months off, I'm kind of looking
forward to working again.</p>
<p>Until then, stay happy.</p>
