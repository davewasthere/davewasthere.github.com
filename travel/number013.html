<!-- start body -->



		<p>I find it hard to decide how to structure these things. For lack of any better 
			method I'm writing them pretty much chronologically. But sometimes it slips 
			into stream of consciousness type thoughts so forgive me if I start to get a 
			little incoherent. It's also a bit of a problem when I leave it so long between 
			updates. So much seems to happen, it's hard to summarise it all. Shame I'm so 
			lazy I guess...</p>
		<P>Mind you, it's only been 9, 10, 11, 12 months since my last verbiage 
        (shit, where'd that year go?). That's enough time to 
			germinate a human being. Crikey! What have I been doing?</P>
		<p>Well, if you are at all interested, here are some quick links to the content in 
			this travelogue;</p>

		<p>It's only the first half of 2003 though. But I haven't finished 
        writing about the other stuff, so here's what I've got to date.</p>
		<h2><a name="No longer ShadyDave">No longer ShadyDave</a></h2>
		<p>I'm changing my name. No longer ShadyDave, I'm Bad Boy Beer™. This is due to me 
			now officially being a criminal.</p>
		<p>Last year I got pulled over for doing 105mph in the porker. And I've just been 
			to court to have my licence taken away. (Only for seven days though) I was a 
			bit stressed out over the whole process, but hey, perhaps it'll learn me a 
			lesson. (Not!)</p>
		<p>What was lovely though, is I lost my licence for the Easter break. Because you'd 
			never want to drive anywhere while the sun is out and you have four days off, 
			right? Why couldn't it have been the previous month? I didn't even <b>use</b> the car 
			then... </p>
		<p>Oh well... never mind.</p>
		<p>I'm not going to bore you with the details apart from it was a completely empty 
			stretch of the M5 and I didn't overtake anybody. I went for a short squirt over 
			a mile or two, then, when I reached a group of four cars, I slowed down and 
			went at their speed. About 30 seconds later, someone speeds up behind me, then 
			on come the blues. Gutted!</p>
		<p>One thing that was a little funny, is the patrol car's engine was smoking 
			furiously when I went and had a chat to the boys who nicked me. They'd blown up 
			their car and it wouldn't start again. Serves them right. They shouldn't have 
			been speeding in the first place. Perhaps if I'd not slowed down, I'd have 
			gotten clean away. I'll just have to make sure I'm a good boy from now on.</p>
		<p>A final observation. I know the Magistrates aren't exactly meant to be chummy. 
			But the guy I had was a complete prick. (Just thought I'd mention that)</p>
		<h2><a name="A new pad">A new pad</a></h2>
		<p>First thing on the agenda after the last travelogue is we managed to find a 
			house to buy. Well, if I was living in New Zealand I'd mean a house when I say 
			a house, but here in the UK what I really mean is a small-ish 2 bed apartment 
			for an exorbitant sum of money. I don't know what half a million Kiwi dollars 
			buys back home, but I'm sure it gets a lot more than it will this side of the 
			planet. Still, for the most part we are pretty happy with the place and I think 
			we might even be able to afford some furniture in a few months. 
        (actually, now that I'm editing this a few months later, I can say yes, 
        we did manage to afford some furniture. But we had to stop eating to do 
        so...)</p>
		<p><img src="images013/our_pad.jpg" ><br>
			<b>Our humble abode. Our flat in in the top left corner.</b></p>
		<p>I don't often convert back to Kiwi dollars. Not after four years 
			abroad. You just wouldn't buy anything here if you did keep comparing. But 
			sometimes you can't help it. Especially when you are forking out some 
			outrageous sum of money for this or that and you know that you could have got 
			the exact same thing (or better) for almost half the price back home. Just part 
			of the joy of living here I guess. :)</p>
		<h2><a name="How to lose 7 kilos in one week">How to lose 7 kilos in one week</a></h2>
		<p>Actually, I wouldn't recommend this diet to anyone. Even Atkins is 
        preferable (at least then you get to eat fatty food). It's a pretty awful way to 
			lose weight, but here goes.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			Fly to the Philippines
			<li>
			Go to Chilli's restaurant in Makati, Manila.
			<li>
			Order a large steak - medium rare.
			<li>
			When it comes out very rare (read raw), send it back for it to be cooked, just a little 
			more.
			<li>
			When it comes back, still very rare, decide "What the heck" and eat it. (was 
			delicious...)
			<li>
			Let it brew for about 6-12 hours
			<li>
				Then spend the next five days on the toilet.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Not really very pleasant. And it did ruin the few days I was in Dubai. I spent 
			most of the time in bed. And I couldn't enjoy any hummus and lamb, or 
			zinger-twister or any of the other food I miss so much from Dubai.</p>
		<p>At least it was at the end of the holiday, that is all I can say. I would have 
			been gutted to get sick on one of the first few days.</p>
		<p>We flew straight out to the Philippines from Heathrow (stopping once at Dubai to 
			switch planes). Funnily enough, Emirates gave us metal utensils for the Dubai 
			-&gt; Manila leg. Post September 11, that is a pretty rare occurrence. Maybe it 
			is just for flights to/from UK/US that you have to eat with shitty plastic 
			knives and forks. I call it overkill, as even the metal utensils aren't exactly 
			super-weapons. Less lethal than the airline food surely...</p>
		<p>First thing we did after arriving in Manila is go check in to our hotel, have a 
			quick kip, then head out for a drink. I tasted my first San Miguel Super-Dry. 
			And it was good.<br>
			Something that is pretty cool here is the licensing hours. Not as backward as 
			the UK's. The bar we were in stayed open until 5am. That is late enough for the 
			hardest drinkers... (pubs closing at 11pm is a bit of a joke really) 
        That said, we've since been to Cardyff, where the pubs don't tend to 
        close until 2am. Which is something the Welsh do better than the 
        English. :-)</p>
		<p>Next day we headed off for a few nights at <a href="http://www.cocobeach.com/">Coco 
				beach</a>. We stayed in our little bungalow, a minutes walk from the beach. 
			Getting into the holiday mood with nothing but beach, swimming, sun, food and 
			the occasional San Miguel.</p>
		<p><img src="images013/view_from_room.jpg" ><br>
			<b>The view from our little hut. The beach is about a one minute walk down the 
				path.</b></p>
		<p>
			We caught the water-taxi to Puerto Galera where we were accosted by a ton of 
			tricycles asking us if we'd like to go to White Beach. Liezl instantly 
			regretted having a puti (white) boyfriend and pretended she didn't know me. We 
			caught a tricycle to the town centre to score some lunch.</p>
		<p>
			We wandered around the street markets, having little snacky-things 
            from the different stalls. I remember the fish balls being 
            especially delicious. I scored some fresh juice, which was served to 
            me in a plastic bag and straw.</p>
		<p>
			Something I noticed is that animals have a pretty rough time here in 
            the Philippines. We saw one dog get run over three times. It's legs 
            were completely useless when we first saw it, and it managed to get 
            under the wheels of almost every vehicle that passed. (No such thing 
            as the SPCA here I think)</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images013/another_hard_day_at_the_office.jpg" ><br>
			<b>Our own little beach. Was a lovely cool 30-ish degrees.</b></p>
		<p>
			We caught one boat out to a 'private' beach with about 10 other 
            people. The beach was fantastic. So much gorgeous coral and 
            water-life like I'd never seen before. What was mildly amusing (but 
            mostly painful) was the horde of boats that arrived shortly after we 
            did. The enterprising locals figured out that they can do a roaring 
            trade by following the now-trapped tourists and pester them until 
            they've either bought something from everyone, or gotten completely 
            wound up and told everyone to piss off. I never quite got to the 
            point of telling them to bugger off, but it was pretty annoying.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images013/who_gets_the_cold_glass.jpg" ><br>
			<b>This was funny. I always got the chilled pint and Liezl got the warm wine glass. 
				Even though we both drank San Miguel.</b></p>
		<p>
			At the end of the three days I think we'd read all our books and were about 
			beached out. Don't know how to relax perhaps? But whatever, it was time to head 
			back to Manila and hire a vehicle to drive out to Liezl's hometown 
            of Mabitac.</p>
		<p>
			Hiring a vehicle was an education. We first checked out the prices 
            at the airport. They weren't bad, but there was all sorts of issues 
            like what cars were available, and what credit cards they did or 
            didn't take. (didn't like Visa much)<br>
            We also had one guy who was insisting on being our driver for the 
            full 10 days. He'd sleep in the car and drive us wherever we wanted 
            to go. All included in the price of the vehicle.</p>
		<p>
			In the end, we went into town and found a brand new van (similar to 
            a landcruiser, but only 2WD) for rent that was fully half the price 
            of the old banged-up Toyota tercels at the airport. Had to pay in 
            cash, and promise not to rev the shit out of it, as it was still 
            being run-in. But it was a sweet ute. Even had an in-car video 
            player.</p>
		<p>
			Driving wasn't much of a culture shock, not after driving in Dubai. In fact I 
			quickly got used to overtaking in the fourth lane. (I think it's called the 
			shoulder in New Zealand) The hardest thing was responding to Liezl's 
            directions. "Turn right here", she says, while meaning left.</p>
		<p>
			We made it to Mabitac without killing anyone, which is quite an achievement 
			really. I quickly learnt to honk the horn every time we passed a 
            horde of children along the way. (Not that they paid me much 
            attention)</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images013/preparing_for_lunch.jpg" ><br>
			<b>Two of Yey's Nieces. Sandrine and Citadel. We are just getting ready to eat.</b></p>
		<p>
			We spent just over a week in Mabitac. Loved it. There is a 17th 
            century church built on the hilltop (ostensibly to protect it from 
            the flooding). Liezl showed me the spot where their priest was 
            killed by a burglar. (bit rough that)</p>
		<p>
			One of the first things I saw in the village was about 20 kids all 
            dancing. That is something I loved about the place. Kids dance a lot 
            here.</p>
		<p>
			We just mucked around most of the time. I met some of the local 
            lads, played pool and all that. We drank San-Miguel (costing all of 
            13 Pesos, about 40 cents NZ) at night outside in the street at night 
            while ladies came round selling puto (rice cake, which I've fallen 
            in love with) and
            <a href="http://www.asiacuisine.com.sg/Nacws/1998/9/314/">balut</a> 
            (partially developed duckling, still in the egg, which I couldn't 
            quite bring myself to eat).</p>
		<p>
			One night there was a wake down the road. Which seemed to involve a 
            lot of food and people holding a mini street party. The casket is 
            displayed inside and the ladies sit around and gossip, while the 
            men-folk gamble at mahjong.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images013/boys_fishing_for_lunch.jpg" ><br>
			<b>I don't know. Shopping for lunch? Didn't see them catch anything, but sometimes 
				that isn't the point</b></p>
		<p>
			Occasionally, when I needed money, we'd go hunting for a money 
            machine. It was a little more difficult getting a compatible one 
            than I thought. But that's cause I've only got a cirrus/maestro 
            card, not a link one any more...</p>
		<p>
			After Mabitac it was time to spend a few more days in Manila. We 
            returned our vehicle, then checked in to the <a href="http://fasttrack.manila.peninsula.com/">
				Manila Peninsula Hotel</a>. A rather swanky joint which was quite 
			acceptable. Unfortunately, we never seemed to wake up in time to 
            enjoy the free breakfasts, but never mind... There was tons of good food 
            on offer outside.</p>
		<p>
			Shopping in Manila was a little crowded. Also, whenever you enter a 
            mall, you get searched by security guards. That's been the case 
            since well before Sept 11th though.</p>
		<p>
			I think we just spent the days shopping, and the nights out 
            eating/drinking. At least until the last day. That's when I spent 
            the entire day in bed delirious apparently. (I honestly remember 
            very little of it)</p>
		<p>
			Fortunately the doctor at the airport cleared me for travel to 
            Dubai. I was so sick, all I wanted to do was lie down and die. But I 
            toughed the doctors examination out saying that I was feeling a lot 
            better and it was just something I ate. Just as well that whole SARS 
            scare hadn't happened yet, otherwise I'd have definitely been held 
            back for a few days.</p>
		<p>
			Emirates upgraded us to Business (I think because we were last on 
            the flight) and<b> really</b> looked after me, making sure I was as 
            comfortable as could be. I still miss working for them, as they are 
            a fantastic airline.</p>
		<p>And like I said, Dubai was pretty uneventful for me. I spent almost 
        the whole time in bed, only just managing to eat a little on the last 
        day there. Sob!</p>
        <p>Still, I had a fantastic trip, and would love to go back to both the 
        Philippines and Dubai soon.</p>
		<h2>
			<a name="Sweltering in Switzerland">Sweltering in Switzerland</a></h2>
		<p>
			Fabrice, one of the guys from work, invited Liezl and I over to 
            Switzerland for his 30th birthday. It was a 
            last-weekend-of-the-season skiing holiday.</p>
		<p>
			Switzerland is so cool, because Liezl doesn't need a visa to go 
            there. As long as you have right to remain in the UK, you can obtain 
            a visa on arrival. I, of course, have no issues with visas once 
            again.</p>
		<p>
			I think that would be one thing I change when I am world dictator. 
            I'd make it that anyone can live/visit/work anywhere, no matter 
            where you were born. We should be people of the planet, not isolated 
            little countries.</p>
		<p>
			But anyway, enough babbling. We went to Geneva, and the first thing 
            I found out after arriving, was the hotel that I booked (In Geneva) 
            wasn't in Switzerland. It was in France. Bloody hell! That's because 
            the Swiss/France border cuts right through Geneva. (Shame I hadn't 
            boned up a bit more on my geography eh?)</p>
		<p>
			Since Liezl wasn't allowed in France without applying weeks before 
            for a visa, we had no choice but to book another hotel in town. 
            (This time on the Swiss side of the border) Fortunately, the hotel 
            we found was in a great location, right next to food and shopping, 
            so it worked out pretty well.</p>
		<p>
			We met up with everybody else at the Airport the next morning and 
            our convoy made it's way to Fabrice's parent's place near Lausanne. 
            Their house overlooked Lake Geneva and the mountains beyond. It was 
            fantastic to see proper mountains again. The whole place seemed 
            similar in beauty to the South Island. Only the castles the dotted 
            the landscape are several centuries older than anything we've got in 
            NZ of course.</p>
		<p>
			After a massive feast, we completed our journey to Sion where we 
            were staying. We could see the Matterhorn from the chalet where we 
            stayed.</p>
		<p>
			The next three days were basically 
            eat/snowboard/eat/snowboard/drink/eat/drink/nap then repeat. Getting 
            back to Geneva was actually a relief. I'm amazed how much energy 
            Fabrice and the others had to go snowboarding while having so few 
            hours of sleep. All very Kenco Rappor - Live now, Sleep later. Only 
            I'm pretty useless without at least 6 hours of sleep.</p>
		<p>
			I think I've become bit of a snow snob as well. Since it was March, 
            the snow was a thin covering on the ground. It was slushy and icy. 
            Not much fun for me, so I didn't even bother getting a lift pass. 
            Just stayed on the baby slopes with Liezl playing around like 12 
            year old kids. She gave up snowboarding and hired some skis which 
            she took to pretty much instantly, having not much luck with 
            boarding.</p>
		<p>
			Back to Geneva though. We stayed another night there before heading 
            home to Blighty. Ate dinner in a fantastic little pizzeria. 
            Actually, that is one of the odd things about the Swiss. They seem 
            to not so much have their own cuisine, but rather steal other 
            nationalities food, and just do it better. French, Italian, 
            German... doesn't matter. They'll take what's best out of the lot, 
            and do it even better.</p>

			<a name="Is there a beach in Bournemouth">Is there a beach in 
            Bournemouth?</a></h2>
		<p>
			I know it sounds silly, but so far I've not seen any beaches in the 
            UK. Sure I've been to several coasts (West, South and East) But 
            have yet to see something I'd call a beach.</p>
		<p>
			I have seen cliffs, pebbles, piers, mud-flats and rocks in a 
            sea-side setting. But I've yet to see that crucial element that I 
            thought was always an essential component of a beach.</p>
		<p>
			Sand. Where the hell is it all? There are a few sandy beaches around 
            (apparently). I just haven't been to one yet.</p>
		<p>
			Anyhow, a group of us decided to go for a burn to the lovely coastal 
            town of Bournemouth for a picnic.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images013/and_they_call_this_a_beach.jpg" ><br>
			<b>Having a wee picnic at Boltons Bench.</b></p>
		<p>
			The trip down was a laugh. Originally, we were going to hire a van, 
            but that fell through, as it was a long weekend (bank holiday) and 
            there were no vans available at all. So in the end, we only had 2 
            cars going down (not much of a convoy). But it was a lovely day, so 
            why not.</p>
		<p>
			First stop was Stonehenge for the people who hadn't been there 
            before. This was the first time I'd seen it crowded too, and since 
            it was my third trip, I just stayed in the field (the car park was 
            full) and chatted to other people hanging around.</p>
		<p>
			Next was a sweet drive through New Forrest. Pretty. Horsies. Trees. 
            Grass. Truth is, I wasn't really concentrating on the scenery. I was 
            too busy throwing the car around corners. (There were some nice 
            windy stretches of road just asking for it)</p>
		<p>
			After getting to Bournemouth, I found that the beach itself was a 
            bit of a let down. Absolutely packed full of people with a tiny 
            strip of sand. I guess seeing beaches like this really make me think 
            how spoilt for choice we are in NZ.</p>

		<p>Yeah, I don't think many of the old Air Force boys I was down in 
        Wigram with will believe it, but I finally finished my 1040

        really start the thing back in 1990? My goodness!</p>
		<p>I'd better hope I never try and do a degree. How will I ever finish 
        my last paper with all the racket that my Grandchildren make?</p>
		<h2>That's all from me folks...</h2>
		<p>I really do have to be getting away now. I've still got our Greece 
        trip to write up, and shortly I'll have a New 
        Zealand trip to write about (after a three year absence). I'm really 
        looking forward to it. Hope to catch up with as many people as possible 
        in the short time I'll have available.</p>
