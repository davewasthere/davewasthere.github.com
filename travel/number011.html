<!-- start body -->

<p>Has it really been so long? Bloody hell! Where did all the time
go? I probably have to apologise to a lot of people in this
travelogue. I've been pretty crap at keeping in touch. Also, it has
taken me ages to even start writing this. I've just been pretty
flat out on my current project. But more about that later...</p>

<p>I don't know why it takes me so long to write one of these.
Maybe it's the lack of travelling. I've sort of settled here, so
things seem less exciting. It's still good fun of course, but
travelling seems to add something a little extra.</p>

<h2><b>Back in the UK</b></h2>

<p>First piece of news (well, hopefully most people will know this
already) is that I am back in the UK. I spent about three months
out in Dubai. Enough to get used to it again at least. I thoroughly
enjoyed my time there, and still miss the place a lot. In a lot of
ways I regret not staying out there a bit longer. There is a lot to
miss about the place, but I'm quite enjoying being back here for
now.</p>

<p>I had some hassles from customs/immigration about returning to
the UK. I guess it was due to me returning on a visit visa so soon
after being here on a travelling-holidaymaker one. It's not an
issue now though, as I've taken a permanent role and now reside
under a proper work visa.</p>

<h2><b>Finding a flat</b></h2>

<p>First thing we had to do is look for some quick digs. Liezl's
job is in Cheltenham, and we were looking for a flat somewhere near
the Hospital. First person I called was Hamish Mead who lived in
nearby Hereford. He found us a room available at the Bristol and
Gloustershire gliding club at Nympsfield. The room was super-cheap,
and was a good base to hunt for a flat from. I also got into a
little spot of gliding. I've done about 7 flights and really
enjoyed it. Although, I've been a little too busy to keep it up,
which is a shame.</p>

<b>That towing van on the right was like that before I drove it.
Honest.</b></p>

<b>Click on the picture to see 'Dave the pilot' in action. I was at
the controls for this takeoff. (142kbytes)</b></p>

<p>The flat search was a bit of a mission. Unfortunately I am
completely anal about my car (I am improving though). I wanted
somewhere with parking and a spare bedroom to use as a study. Liezl
wanted a garden and a nice kitchen (and close to the hospital). We
looked at tons of places, and found something pretty decent. The
only thing I had to give up was the parking, as the flat is in a
row of terraces. So the poor Porsche gets left out on the street.
It's been six months and no dents/scratches worth crying about yet
(touch wood), but I'd still prefer to either get rid of the car, or
get a place with proper parking.</p>

<p>The house could have been closer to Liezl's work (we are about a
mile away from the hospital), but the garden is really nice to have
and you just don't get that any closer to town. (or you might, but
it'll be damn hard to find) It's only a ten minute walk to get into
the centre of Cheltenham, and the 24 hour Tesco is only 5-7 minutes
away. So it's pretty convenient</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images011/back_yard.JPG" width="496"
height="300" alt=
"Of course it doesn't look like this NOW. The lawns need mowing, the garden needs weeding, and the flowers are all dead.">
<br>
<b>I don't have a decent wide angle for inside the house, but at
least I can show you the back yard. Tiny isn't it... But it's a
pretty size decent for the UK. (sad)</b></p>

<p>We did find a couple of great places that might have been more
suitable, but they didn't have showers. I just can't understand
having a house without a shower... Crazy Brits. Now that we've been
living here for about 6 months we are reasonably happy with the
place. It's a 10 minute walk to town which is really nice.
Cheltenham is a great place to live to. It's nice being outside the
M-25 for a little while.</p>

<h2><b>Sept 11th attack</b></h2>

<p>I thought I'd mention this, as it's a pretty huge event. I think
I was the last person on the planet to find out about it. While
everyone else was glued to their TV sets, I was busy coding away...
That is one of the problems of working at home. No social
interaction. Liezl ended up calling me from work to see whether I'd
heard. After that it was a very unproductive day.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images011/Southtower.jpg" alt=

<img border="0" src="images011/wtc1.jpg" alt=
"Bloody big chimney stacks!" width="551" height="400"><br>
<b>Pretty scary images. Especially if you were the insurance
underwriter!</b></p>

<p>I turned on the television set and was hooked. What a
spectacular. New video footage of planes coming in from different
angles. The buildings collapsing. Pentagon in flames. It was a
scene from some crazy action film. Only this was real.</p>

<p>But the whole 'America under Attack' theme got boring very
quickly. The bit that blows me away is how publicised the whole
thing is. It seems like hypocrisy to go so over the top about a
terrorist attack on America that kills 4000 people, yet hardly
anything was shown (in comparison) about the 800,000 odd people
murdered in Rwanda during the 1994 genocide.</p>

<p>And while some of the footage was a little frightening (people
jumping out of the building etc...) it still wasn't as scary as
that wedding video in Israel where the floor collapsed under all
those people. That still rates as the scariest thing I've ever
seen.</p>

<h2><b>The state of the IT market</b></h2>

<p>Things are pretty rough in the contracting market here. I've
never known so many people to be out of work. It's beginning to
pick up again, but I'm a little doubtful whether it will ever fully
recover from the dotcom bust and recent recession. Bit of a bugger
of a time to be looking for work, but there you go...</p>

<h2><b>My Project</b></h2>

<p>Not sure what to say about this. It's sort of been some mixed
blessings here. I originally took a three month contract which
extended into crazy lengths. I've now chewed through all my savings
and am reasonably miserable with the way the whole thing has worked
out. It's a long story, and I'm not going to go into it here, but
basically I've learnt a lot and (hopefully) won't be making the
same mistakes again.</p>

<p>That said, there are some good things come out of it, so it's
not a total loss. But I must admit, I still sometimes wish I'd
stayed in Dubai. But you never know till you try these things do
you...</p>

<h2><b>Almost a white Christmas</b></h2>

<p>My Dad came over to stay for Christmas. Which was great, because
I wasn't able to go to New Zealand. (Just too darn busy) Also, it
saved me the hassle of travelling. I've never done the UK-NZ flight
non-stop. And I'm not sure I ever want to. It has to be pretty
tough on the body. My idea of travelling is to never cross more
than four hours worth of time zones in any given week. If I could
I'd go by boat. Or better than that, just stop off twice for a few
days in places like Dubai, Singapore, Los Angeles and New York.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images011/dad_in_snow.JPG" alt=
"Where is my golfball?" width="596" height="480"><br>
<b>We had a little bit of snow, but it disappeared after a day or
two.</b></p>

<p>It was a bugger that I had to work while he was over. I really
wanted to go touring Italy or something while he was here, but with
the project extending to April (gulp) I wasn't able to take much
time off. (I'd already booked 6 days leave for my snowboarding trip
in Jan/Feb 2002) That said, we did manage to get around and see a
few sights. Saw Stonehenge, yet again. Ran up and played in the
couple of inches of snow that dumped in the hills next to
Cheltenham. Out to dinner a lot. Looked around London, that sort of
thing.</p>

<p>One frustrating thing is having a two-seater car. I had to hire
a car to get the three of us in to London. Not that big a deal, but
sometimes it'd just be easier owning something a little more
practical. (Think I may have to sell it some time this year...)</p>

<h2><b>Paris for a day</b></h2>

<p>Did a day trip to Paris which was great value. We drove down to
Portsmouth and caught the night ferry across the channel. I can't
say I slept at all on the way over, but coming back was okay.
(Guess I was completely knackered by then)</p>

<p>One thing I did notice in France was how fast everyone drives.
I thought they drove quickly over here! That said though, the roads
were good and the petrol was cheap compared to the UK. But they
make up for cheap petrol by having toll booths every 20-30kms along
the motorway. I was a little freaked out when we came to the first
one. Here I was thinking that I've got no Euro money yet, and have
to go through a toll booth. There are three different types of
lanes, one with a 't' symbol, which looks like it's for some sort
of electronic smart-ticket, another few lanes with the word cartes
(meaning cards), which take credit cards, then the trusty
people-manned lanes that you can give change or cards to. These
last lanes have a symbol of a person inside a box. The toll booths
do have the effect of smoothing out the traffic, so you never come
across huge clumps of trucks or slow moving cars. All in all it
seems to work well. And it must help pay for those incredible
tunnels you come to as you drive into Paris! I'm not sure if I've
ever been through anything so long. 3-4km long tunnels leading
straight into the heart of the city.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images011/pissing_down.JPG" alt=
"At least its not raining... Oh, hang on..." width="597" height=
"480"><br>
<b>Bloody hell! Where did all this #$%&amp;*! rain come
from?</b></p>

<p>Unfortunately it was a pretty miserable day to be walking around
Paris, but after we scored an umbrella each, it was a little more
bearable. The highlight of my day was getting around with my
incredibly basic French. I can barely speak it, yet we still
managed to get around without any big fuss. Most people we met
couldn't (or wouldn't) speak English, but in a way that just made
it more satisfying once you successfully ordered a couple of
coffees. It made mundane things seem like great achievements.</p>

<p>We did the typical tourist things, L'arc de Triomphe, Eiffel
Tower, Notre Dame etc... And spent the rest of the day drinking
coffee (trying to keep away after a mostly sleepless night). We
barrelled back to Le Havre with plenty of time to spare for the
return crossing. This time I managed to get a bit more sleep on the
ferry. I guess it helped being completely exhausted...</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images011/eiffel_tower.JPG" alt=
"Slightly more humidity than I normally like." width="351" height=

<b>I'm not sure was this big antenna thing is, but it looked pretty
neat!</b></p>

<p><img border="0" src="images011/parking_skills.JPG" alt=
"Just a little kiss." width="250" height="400"><br>
<b>They like to park a little more intimately in Paris.</b></p>

<p>But time seemed to fly very quickly, and the next thing I know I
was dropping Dad off at the airport for his hellish 30-hour journey
back to NZ.</p>

<h2><b>Montana - Powder country!</b></h2>

<p>I'm of two minds to tell people about how great the snow in
Montana is. I mean, if I tell tons of people, and you all flock
there, then it is my fault if the place is incredibly busy next
time I go. But the snow was so good, if I don't tell people, then I
think I will explode!</p>

<p>Damn that snow was good.</p>

<p>It's funny. We had almost no snow in Europe, but there was tons
in Montana. In Cheltenham, we got a couple of inches settling on
the hills just north of the town, but apart from that, nada. If
anything, it's been unseasonably warm in the UK. I just remember it
still snowing in London in April last year. (didn't settle, but it
snowed at least) I don't know what happened, but there just isn't
snow in Europe.</p>

<p>But there was a lot of snow in Montana. And it was good. :-)</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images011/big_mountain.JPG" alt=
"Yup. Good snow alright!" width="517" height="400"><br>
<b>Mmmmm... That glorious powder. But remember. It wasn't as good
as it looks. (Not worth the trip really. Don't go... Stay
home...)</b></p>

<p>Admittedly the visibility sucked most of the time. For two of
the days we got some nice sunny spells, just after it dumped a
bunch of fresh snow. You couldn't ask for anything better than
that. But the rest of the time, the cloud cover was in and it just
kept dumping more snow. (Did I say that the snow was good?)</p>

<p>There was too much snow though. All that powder can't be good
for you... I'm totally spoilt for boarding in Europe now.</p>

<p>I can't say I progressed as a boarder. I was having to much fun
in that great snow to concentrate on improving my technique.
Although, I did manage to do a few jumps without falling down. But
even when I did fall down after doing a jump, it didn't matter.
Because all that great powder snow was breaking my fall. HA HA!</p>

<p>You can probably tell I had a good time. And I did. I think it
helped me un-stress a huge amount. (10 days in great snow has that
effect on me)</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images011/me_in_montana.JPG" alt=
"Did I mention how good the snow was?" width="387" height=
"300"><br>
<b>See! Don't I look relaxed?</b></p>

<p>Whitefish was a great little town, and everyone was really
friendly. I didn't have a fantastic opinion of Americans before I
went, but they are much improved in my eyes now. (They still have
this strange notion that their country is the best in the world for
some reason though....)</p>

<p>Something I noticed was almost all of the men in Montana sported
a beard of some sort. I think that the Golden Shower ski-team (us)
were the only guys in the State that didn't have beards. So half of
us grew them over the time we were there. (The other half looked
like girls, but they didn't seem to mind) Major kudos to Paul for
the Golden Shower ski team name. Apparently we were there
celebrating the Queen's Golden Jubilee. We got a lot of interest
from locals wondering whether we were some professional sportsmen.
Obviously they didn't see our utter lack of skill on the slope, or
the general unfit-flabby-untoned bodies that we possessed. Go
figure!</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images011/couple_of_beers.JPG" alt=
"What a dopey expression. Glad I'm drunk." width="658" height=
"300"><br>
<b>I'm not sure, but there may have been some drinking.</b></p>

<p>Something else that I noticed, was America was at war with some
terrorists apparently. And just in case you happened to have a
3-minute memory span, they told you, over and over and over again.
(layer upon layer upon layer...) It got on my wick a bit. Nice to
see they've sorted out the Taliban though. I couldn't imagine a
more deserving group of arseholes.</p>

<h2><b>Itlog na maalat - Filipino salted egg</b></h2>

<p><img border="0" src="images011/itlog.jpg" width="108" height=
"110" alt="Yummy! Thank god it isn't Balut!"></p>

<p>I had my first go at making Filipino salted egg. It's called
<i>Itlog na maalat.</i> (which just means salty egg - funnily
enough) Basically, what you do is make up a super-saturated
solution of salted water. Just putting more and more salt into the
water until no more dissolves. Then you put raw eggs in for about
2-4 weeks. (depending on how salty you want them to get) I guess
they just absorb the salt through the shell. Once they have been in
the solution long enough, you take them out and boil them. They
normally get coloured red (with food colouring) to distinguish them
from normal eggs. Yey says that I should use duck eggs preferably.
But to start with I went for the basic chicken variety. I left them
in for three weeks, but they probably would have tasted better with
another week I reckon.</p>

<p>The salt evaporates a little, and a film built up all over the
bowl. I was breaking off 3mm thick salt crusts. Wicked!</p>

<h2><b>Wedding Bells</b></h2>

<p>For those of you who know them, Hamish and Sarita got hitched.
Crazy huh? I think Sarita must have been on crack, but at least
Hamish has a job and doesn't smell too awful, so maybe it wasn't
such a bad idea. I'll was there with my digital, so here are a few
pictures from the experience.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images011/h_s_getting_ready.jpg" width=
"340" height="480" alt="Noooooooo!!!! Don't do it.... (good luck)">
<img border="0" src="images011/h_s_done_the_deed.jpg" width="353"

"0" src="images011/h_s_out_of_the_boot.JPG" width="510" height=
"480" alt="Remember to pour me one Jackass!"></p>

<p>T'was a jolly good day, and we even got some nice sun for the
champers out in the car park. The dinner was absolutely delicious.
The actual ceremony was over pretty quick. I think both Hamish and
Sarita were a little nervous. I'm not sure I've heard the vows said
so quickly before. Cheers to them both, and here is to a happy
future together!</p>

<h2><b>Return to Castle Wolfenstein</b></h2>

<p>It's getting old now (well, at least a few months old), but I
still love this game. Liezl bought me RTCW for Christmas, and I've
been playing it ever since. I think I've gotten reasonably good at
it too. I play as <b>Womble-NZ</b>, and this is my highest score so
far (302). Most players I play against come from Belgium, Germany,
Sweden, France or the UK. But it's nice when a wee lad from
Kiwi-land whips their puny butts!</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images011/rtcwhighscore_302.jpg" width=
"640" height="480" alt=
"Wow. That Womble is pretty evil with an MP40."></p>

<p>There is a new game out called Medal of Honour - Allied Assault
that I wouldn't mind getting my hands on. But so far I haven't been
keen enough to pay the &pound;34.99 price in the shops. I'll wait a
few months and get it when it's a little more reasonable I
think.</p>

<h2><b>Selling the Porsche</b></h2>

<p>Yeah, I know it's a bit rough, but I'm hoping to buy a flat, and
I could use the money. So if anyone knows of someone stupid and
rich. Point them my way. That said, it is a bit sad to see it go. I
haven't had any nibbles yet, but I've only had it advertised a
week.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images011/for_sale_cheep.JPG" width="669"
height="300" alt="FOR SALE - CHEEP!"><br>
<b>FOR SALE - CHEEP!</b></p>

<p>Still, I won't be too bothered if it doesn't sell. Summer's
coming, and it is going to be nice to have then. (Have to biff the
hard top out in to the shed though)</p>

<h2><b>Dubai didn't happen</b></h2>

<p>Yey and I were <i>meant</i> to head out to Dubai for a short
visit to see her daughter, but it didn't happen. The lovely people
at UAE immigration have decided that single women under the age of
forty, who require visas, won't be granted them. Bastards! Bit of a
bloody shame we'd bought non-refundable tickets then. (Dammit!)</p>

<p>Apparently it is to stop people from overstaying. Some pathetic
attempt to curb the rampant prostitution that goes on in that
country. I guess from my tone you can pick up that I'm a little
pissed off about it. Well, it did ruin most of our plans. We had a
backup though, which was to go into London and get horribly drunk.
Sure, it wasn't Dubai, but it beat crying about it. Bah! Who wants
to go there anyway. Too much sun and sand for my liking...</p>

<h2>Wrapping up</h2>

<p>I'm about all out of banal things to say, so it looks like time
to sign off yet again. Sorry about the half a meg of images in this
travelogue, but I really couldn't be bothered trying to
mega-optimise them.</p>

<p>I'll try not to leave it so long until the next time. But
knowing me, I probably will.<br>
Ciao all.</p>
