        <h1>Kiwi Dave becomes a Brit!</h1>

        <p><img alt="Emily having a nap" src="images/emily.jpg" /></p>
        <p>I spent a few days in Brisbane with my heavily-pregnant sister on my way back to 
            the UK after spending summer in New Zealand. Unfortunately, she didn&#39;t pop until 
            I left (literally hours after). So I’m now an Uncle to little Jai! So chuffed 
            for Em!</p>
        <h2>Dubai has changed a lot</h2>
        <p>On my way back from Brisbane, I stopped over in Dubai. The amount it&#39;s changed 
            over the years is incredible. I&#39;ve got to admit, I was pretty impressed with 
            Madinat Jumeirah. Last time I saw it, it was sand. Now, it&#39;s this amazing array 
            of shops, restaurants, hotels and nightclubs.</p>

        <p>
            Also got to catch up with a few of my favourite people in the world, the Tuqan 
            clan. Yousef is CEO of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.flipcorp.com">Flip Media</a>. I&#39;d 
            really missed our shisha &amp; backgammon evenings. I know nothing stays the same, 
            but it&#39;s hard not to look back sometimes.</p>

        <h2>Back home in the UK? Or is it?</h2>
        <p>Being back in the UK was a bit of a shock to the system. I’m loving this ‘chasing 
            the sun’ business. Mainly because the UK has been a bit short-changed as far as 
            the sun goes. But it did start me thinking about what I want long term. I&#39;ve 
            enjoyed being back in New Zealand the last couple of years - and got a very 
            tempting job offer this last trip.</p>
        <p>Problem is, I&#39;ve got a foot in both countries. Family are back in NZ, but having 
            spent most of the last decade in Cheltenham, I&#39;ve got friends and a life here 
            that I&#39;d miss if I moved back. Decisions decisions...</p>
        <p>I&#39;d pretty much decided to move back though. The New Zealand trip was so good 
            that I felt a constant pull to return. So I resigned from work and started 
            making preparations...</p>
        <h2>Amsterdam trip with the lads</h2>
        <p>One of my mates, Kev, fancied a lads trip away, so organised a trip for four of 
            us to the ‘dam. I’d been before and sometimes am a bit funny about visiting 
            places I’ve previously visited, but these lads were sound, so was well worth a 
            visit.</p>
        <p>
            <img alt="A couple of monkeys in the tree" src="images/amsterdam-tree.jpg"  /><img alt="Me in an Amsterdam cafe" src="images/cafe.jpg"  /></p>
        <p>It was probably the tamest lads trip to the dam ever, but I had fun. Lots of 
            wandering around like loons, parks, great food, poker, drinks. I’m not into 
            smoking, but still enjoy the place. Still haven’t been to the Anne Frank house 
            though!</p>
        <h2>I get to play at being a Bee Keeper</h2>
        <p>My block of flats had had some bees in the roof the past couple of years. But 
            this spring they ended up swarming. Three queens and their bees all swarmed in 
            one of the trees on the grounds.</p>
        <p>
            <img alt="Dave the Bee-keeper" src="images/dave-the-beekeeper.jpg"  /></p>
        <p>I phoned up a local beekeeper to see if he&#39;d like the bees. They came out and had 
            a look and we decided to get the bees out of the tree and see if we couldn&#39;t get 
            them into boxes. The beekeeper went home for extra boxes for the other swarms 
            and the son and I suited up and figured out how to get the bees out of the tree.</p>
        <p>In the end, I MacGyvered up a lasso-type arrangement at the end of some bamboo 
            (kindly supplied by one of the many neighbours who were spectating. Using that, 
            I could break the branch that the swarms were on, and get the bees down onto the 
            canvas.</p>
        <p>Then it was just a matter of shaking (gently) the bees to try and get the queen 
            of each swarm into the box. Once the queen was in the box, the rest of the bees 
            figured it out and pretty much jumped in there with her.</p>
        <p>
            <img alt="Where's the queen?" src="images/the-kept-bees.jpg"  /></p>
        <p>Turns out these bees are really docile, well behaved bees, so the beekeeper was 
            pretty happy with the three swarms we managed to collect. I got stung once, but 
            wasn&#39;t a biggie.</p>
        <h2>Weekend at the Isle of Wight Festival</h2>
        <p>Still unemployed and enjoying it, a nice surprise was a last minute festival 
            ticket for the Isle of Wight. A friend of mine (Ru) had someone from her group 
            of friends not able to make it. I wasn&#39;t working, so was able to easily head 
            down with them for a long weekend of music and camping.</p>
        <p>Finally got to see the Kooks and Kate Nash (disappointed by her tbh). And loved 
            Newton Faulkner and Amy MacDonald, neither of whom I&#39;d heard much of.</p>
        <p>
            <img alt="Police headlining at Isle of Wight 2008" src="images/isle-of-wight.jpg"  /></p>
        <p>Was really lucky weather-wise too. Was kind of threatening at some points, but 
            mostly was sunny and lovely. Cold at night though! Camping... I&#39;m still not so 
            sure. :-)</p>
        <h2>Keep the rubber side down</h2>
        <p>Got knocked off my bike unfortunately. Second decent bike accident in ten years. 
            Not brilliant. </p>
        <p><img alt="Bike crash on the way to Ledbury" src="images/bike-crash.jpg" /><img alt="The firemen kindly clean up afterwards" src="images/fireengine.jpg"  /></p>
        <p>I was overtaking a slow-ish queue of cars and a Ranger Rover pulled to overtake out without indicating or looking, 
            knocking me off to go sliding down the road at 60mph and my poor VFR got 
            totalled. I luckily got away with a bruised back, sore hip and thumb. I couldn’t 
            walk for a few days afterwards, but I was so well treated by my insurance 
            company.</p>
        <p>They gave me a replacement bike to use so I could sit my IAM exam and 
            managed to get decent reparations from the other driver for my damaged leathers, 
            helmet and bike. Still, I’d have rather not have had the accident in the first 
            place, but at least I don’t feel ripped off in the aftermath. </p>
        <p>An added bonus was, that was one less thing to get rid of before moving back to 
            New Zealand. :-)</p>
        <h2>And then I go and change my mind</h2>
        <p>I&#39;d started having some doubts about whether New Zealand is going to work for me 
            or not. Probably just normal fears of the unknown, but it really started to play 
            on my mind.</p>
        <p>I&#39;d also talked to a lot of friends about my situation. And one of the big 
            considerations was my residency in the UK and what could possibly happen if I 
            left, went back to New Zealand, decided it wasn&#39;t actually for me, then wanted 
            to return.</p>
        <p>It looks as though there was a good chance that when I returned, I&#39;d get 
            re-admitted as a tourist, which would invalidate my Indefinite Leave to Remain. 
            Of course, that would depend on whether I stayed away for two years or not. But 
            I know how easily two years can slip by. Or what if I just wanted to go 
            travelling for a few years? That would also mean I&#39;d lose the right to settle 
            here.</p>
        <p>So it made a lot of sense to apply for Citizenship. My only real problem was the 
            amount of time I&#39;d spent out of the country in the past four years. I was right 
            on the border of not having spent enough time in the UK. (Easily enough for tax 
            residence though - got their priorities straight I guess)</p>
        <h2>Earning a crust again</h2>
        <p>So I was without passport for a while and unable to travel until the application 
            was processed. What to do in the meantime? I put out a couple of feelers to a 
            few contacts and suddenly was inundated with work. When it rains, it pours. That 
            said, I wasn&#39;t complaining.</p>
        <p>Managed to pick up a couple of very interesting projects to work on. The biggest 
            one was a re-write of UCAS&#39;s social media platform (<a 
                href="http://yougo.co.uk">Yougofurther</a>) for students going to 
            University. It went really well and was a nice showcase of an Agile project in 
            an organisation that was exclusively waterfall previously.</p>
        <h2>Holiday at home</h2>
        <p>Since I was lacking a passport, it was time to have a stay-at-home holiday rather 
            than head abroad. So Henning (The crazy German) and I headed out to see Gary (A 
            pint? I really shouldn&#39;t... oh, go on then!) Phillips in Pembrokeshire.</p>
        <p>
            <img alt="Henning heading out for a windsurf at Pembrokeshire" src="images/henning-windsurfing.jpg" /></p>
        <p>Was just a weekend of windsurfing (only the crazy German), walking and well...&nbsp; 
            Beer. All in a good cause though!</p>
        <p>

        <h2>Yet another winter migration</h2>
        <p>After Autumn comes Summer. Or at least, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve done the last couple of 
            years, so it was time to do it once more. This time I was joined by the Crazy 
            German, who fancied a bit of sunshine for Christmas / New Years.</p>
        <p>But I&#39;ll save that for the next travelogue...</p>
