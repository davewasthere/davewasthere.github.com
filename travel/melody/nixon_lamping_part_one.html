<h1>Nixon lamping - Part 1 of the ancestral search.</h1>

<p>The bus pulled into a miscellaneous town on a grey Sunday morning, I wasn't 
sure where or who I was but thought I'd like to find out. Soon all was divulged 
- this was indeed Omagh, county Tyrone, part of the country I'd been living in 
for the past five months, ignorant of it's existence. It had recently made 
itself known as the place of my ancestors, a point of passing for the Nixon clan 
on their migratory route from Scotland to New Zealand, and I had come to 
investigate.<br>
I had two names - Gavaughy and Sixmilecross - possible leads to evidence of 
Nixon occupancy. Talking to a friendly lad I was told there were no buses 
working that day and also those two places were 15 km south east of the town, 
it's a Sunday morning so good luck to ya getting there, but his cousin was 
heading that way anyway, we can give yee a lift, and off we went.<br>
We drove through green picturesque hills and fields, and some stilted 
conversation later I stood in a cloud of fumes from the exhaust of a lone car - 
the lads, as they drove away - and this was the main street of Sixmilecross. 
Nice fat drops of rain landed on me, waking me up, refreshing the long rows of 
attached houses that spread out from the central hub of the butchers shop, pubs 
and a Spar. I headed for the only place with signs of life - Big Bulls (?) pub - 
but another sign intervened on my way across the street - Presbyterian church, 
1/2 m ^. An automatic right and there I am being herded into a friendly looking 
protestant church with the service about to begin. And the service was unusually 
good, the Reverand had some interesting things to say, made more exciting by his 
mention of the fact that by goodness we have a visitor today and we don't often 
have visitors in these parts. <br>
Loitering about afterward I was smiled at by many friendly country folk and soon 
as the word was out that I was a 'tracer', I was passed on to the wise man of 
the village, Mr Weir. Nixons? Aye! Nixons. There's been Nixons in this here 
village for years and years. Well, there's none here now of course, none anymore 
- oh except old Lottie who's in the rest home in Omagh - her husbands in the 
graveyard here, there's a few Nixon's buried here Aye. Och musical people they 
were, musical, played the pipes like yee wouldn't believe, so they did, so they 
did. <br>
A frantic woman then approached asking who I was did I have a car and more 
importantly where was I to have lunch? I don't know. Och well you'll be coming 
with us sure you will. I'll just put the spuds on, and see yee up at the house 
a'right! <br>
The Reverend and Mr Weir then took me around the graveyard, showed me a few 
recent Nixon graves and an unmarked section of the older part which was said to 
be Nixon's too. A search of the church records did not show up any James' 
however, though our hunting was hampered by the fact all the pre-1900's records 
had been burnt in a bombing. James died in 1878. One of the few churches in the 
area without any records. I did not feel the presence of any closely related 
ancestral spirits and with no evidence I was unbelieving. We left the church and 
sauntered up a hill, and right into the Reverand's house. The frantic woman was 
his wife, and quite nice, eager to talk. <br>
The grand Sunday feast was about to be embarked upon when a light joke sent 
order into chaos - Lucky you're not a vegetarian! She said, and visions came to 
me of the Sunday roast in the country and what it meant and how could I have 
possibly have not realised but I can't lie to a Reverand and his wife and I 
couldn't eat that pig/cow/ox anyway - ah, actually, yes, I am. Her recovery was 
quite impressive - her daughters boyfriend in the city was a vegetarian she said 
- and I was placated with three hearty vegetable helpings and a cuppa tae.<br>
The Rev then took me into Omagh to see this mysterious woman Lottie, married to 
the last Nixon who lived in the area, Robert John, long since departed but she 
has a memory like an elephant, he said, she'll give you some names. <br>
<br>
Charlotte Nixon lived now in a resthome but she'd grown up in Sixmilecross, 
could remember her husbands family and gave me a few names here and there. Her 
husband, Robert John, had a variety of sisters and brothers - Maisey, Sisey, Flo, 
William, - and his father was named George Nixon, and his father was also named 
George Nixon. They'd been involved in handyman trades - carpenters, painters, 
fencers. They were intelligent people, she said. All of them had been members of 
the Orange Order, (I'd seen a massive brick building outside sixmilecross that 
was the local Orange Hall) and they'd played in the pipes in the band. She was 
very proud of them, showed me the vase she'd been given by the Order decades 
ago. She couldn't remember anyone who'd ever emigrated to NZ or Australia. She'd 
never heard of a countryhouse called Gavaughy, her and her family lived in the 
village and weren't farmers. She couldn't remember that much more which was 
relevant to me, but she insisted we have a dash of port when the reverand had 
gone and then told me a few stories of her children before growing tired and 
looking at her watch. <br>
Not long after I'd exhausted my last feeble topic of conversation her daughter 
arrived. She was quite interested in why a foreign stranger was sitting talking 
to her mother and became enthused on discovering I was a 'tracer', a Nixon in 
fact, like herself.<br>
<br>
There were a few hours to go before my bus back to Belfast so we went off to see 
the town of Omagh which I imagined was the main hub of the area and once vast 
Nixon families would have descended on it monthly to trade farm goods and have 
Sunday clothes made.<br>
Hazel worked for the council, in the water department, had lived herself in 
sixmilecross and then moved into Omagh and been there ever since. We went up and 
around the main streets, which were charming in a North Irish, winding small 
streets and houses scrunched together with a big cathedral on the hill 
overlooking it all, kind of way, with the modern influence of the 'chippie' - 
fast chip shops, coffee@grinders American cafe's and a few swanky restaurants. 
It was in no way how Grandad's nephew Lance described in back in '92 - the 
soldiers and barricades had gone and not many police, friendly people - however 
I did see where the '94/'95 (?) bomb had blown up, a few big buildings were 
destroyed, one still being repaired, and the street was bumpy and rippled. It 
obviously still had a huge effect on people. We went to the garden of 
remembrance and then the time came for my bus.<br>
<br>
Hazel then decided she would draw up a family tree for me, would contact cousins 
and uncles and aunts out in the countryside who knew more. I vowed to return the 
following week so we could go and meet these other connections, go in search of 
Gavaughy and visit more churches in the area. She was quite excited, as was I, 
although my sneaking suspicions told me we were highly unlikely to have a 
connection it was wonderful meeting nice people from the countryside who did 
after all have the same last name.</p>
