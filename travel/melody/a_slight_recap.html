<p>hello hello,<br>
I have been slack at writing but I guess that happens when one is trapped in 
society and routines. Well! It's May already - I just can't believe it. I also 
can't believe how much I've learnt from Belfast in the past few months, what an 
amazing, dreadful, enlightening city.<br>
There is lots to tell, unfortunately I don't have time right now as I am at work 
and must get on to making up the practical physics exams for the 'A' Levels. <br>
Most important events worth noting:<br>
the arrival of Magnolia, yes, Magnolia Wilson on these shores, she is now living 
in Dublin and we have had a couple of Rendezvous, she is very good and we are on 
a frighteningly alike wavelength, we plan this summers journey together....await 
more details,<br>
last week another visit to Daniel in the south who is also very good, this 
weekend is a 3 day weekend so we are meeting in Donegal (the north-west, part of 
the Republic,) to explore northern Ireland and the west,<br>
a week over in Edinburgh with Ilona which was a nice relaxing break but hard 
also to try and understand things there,<br>
several amazing arts festivals and goings on in Belfast, my writing group going 
incredibly well, have been reading out several 'travel' pieces which have been 
well received and very encouraged, getting to know these amazing writers and 
learning so much from them, especially as they're Irish - Irish writers will 
always be legendary,<br>
the coming and goings of flatmates - cam the Canadian is now off seeking the 
answers, Deidre the kiwi has just left for England, David a Spanish guy has 
arrived, matt the Australian stays firmly on the couch, and the Irish girl Eilis 
continues to be strong willed and drink a lot, <br>
I had a thoroughly shocking and eye opening experience - being beaten up by 2 
rough 'estate' girls in Belfast centre when I tried to calm them down and stop 
them harassing my flatmate, my first experience of physical violence, wow it's 
an awful and animalistic thing especially in mobs, but it was about time I 
realised my weakness and reassessed my&nbsp;'infallibility' and it really teaches you 
a LOT,<br>
learning Russian still it's a very beautiful language&nbsp;- the literature greats 
rival (surpass) the English greats- and reading about it and trying very hard to 
get a 'private' visa to go there - now at the end of June hopefully as I feel I 
should finish my job here until the end of term,<br>
in a couple of weeks it will be my 2 year anniversary of travel and that's 
almost incomprehensible but amazing and unavoidable at the same time, (I'm 
getting a wee month extension on my visa so I can stay the extra month to work), 
I can't believe how much I've changed and I think in very positive ways 
(magnolia and Daniel reinforce this) and I wouldn't want to have my life any 
other way, <br>
....and life continues on full steam but with many slow&nbsp;much needed moments to 
realise one's place in it,<br>
I have a few important questions, the first for everyone : What is the name of 
my great grandfather (or great great grandfather) on Harold's (?) side?<br>
I am told that once our family lived in Omagh, N.I., were planted there and 
lived there for a few hundred years. I'd like to track them down, the 
gravestones of their families, or any info about them, which is very possible to 
do with the big historic societies here, however I can't remember their names so 
any info at all would be helpful. William Nixon, perhaps? or James?<br>
<br>
The second is for Ben : was I ever vaccinated against Diphtheria? Perhaps it is 
standard practice in NZ, I just can't remember and I need to be for Russia.<br>
<br>
O.K. so that's the bell and I must be off, apologies for the hurried and frantic 
nature of this sudden letter, <br>
as it comes into summer here I guess that it goes into winter there, a small 
consolation for the fact that summer here involves chilly winds and grey drifts 
of sleet and bonfires of the pre-marching season paramilitary,<br>
enjoy the natural state of NZ and the winter showers, <br>
looking forward to your news, lots of love from Melody.<br>
