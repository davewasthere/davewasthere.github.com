		<h1>Back on the shores, the shores, the shores</h1>
		<p>
			Hello everyone,</p>
		<DIV>Another group email is here and this time it's coming from the ever changing 
			shores of New Zealand.</DIV>
		<DIV>It's 4 and a half years since I've been here, 4 1/2 years since I've seen my 
			father, talked to my friends face to face, patted my cat and used kiwi terms 
			like "fully" and "stoked."</DIV>
		<DIV>("I'm fully stoked to be here.")</DIV>
		<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
		<DIV>Things have changed in New Zealand, the economy has been booming as much as a 
			tiny island economy can boom and new housing, new roads and new shopping 
			complexes have appeared, filling the coastlines and suburbs. Development is a 
			fashionable word and suddenly everyone's proud to be a kiwi.
		</DIV>
		<DIV>'The Lord of the Rings' had a huge impact on the national psyche and at once 
			these timid but friendly beer swilling kiwis have realized that they live in an 
			amazing place that the rest of the world is fairly respectful (and envious) of, 
			and that's given them the strength to believe they can actually do things.
		</DIV>
		<DIV>Like try to prevent 27,000 hectares of beautiful south island mountains being 
			sold to Shania Twain (unfortunately the sale happened anyway) and yet more 
			billion dollar 'pieces of heaven' being sold to overseas - American - buyers, 
			who will use these valleys and peninsulas and mountain passes as summer 
			residences, or golf courses, or worse.
		</DIV>
		<DIV>Or try to stop overseas fishing boats trawling in protected no fishing zones. 
			Everyone's planting native trees and protesting if any native bush is cleared. 
			Organic produce has almost become affordable and a bill to give gay couples the 
			same rights as married hetero couples is currently being put through 
			government.</DIV>
		<DIV>Such are the issues and concerns of little old N.Z.</DIV>
		<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
		<DIV>I've been away for what feels like such a long time, and seen and thought and 
			felt so much, and the country has changed quite dramatically, but I still feel 
			so at home here and I still identify with my friends and family. Which is a 
			lovely surprise. Waking up in my dad and Ruth's hippie house up the Paranui 
			valley, with the bush all around and the native birds singing, the cabbage 
			trees in flower just outside my window and the Panga (tree ferns) dipping and 
			bowing in the wind - what could be nicer?
		</DIV>
		<DIV>I've been doing lots of gardening since I've been here, planting my secretly 
			imported 'cocomarazzi' (Italian melon) plants (don't tell anyone), and starting 
			a garden of medicinal herbs. Then helping my dad and Ruth out on the land, 
			making walking tracks through the bush, clearing away weeds and looking after 
			the new baby calves. And of course doing some sculpturing and wood work in 
			Ruth's amazing 'studio.'</DIV>
		<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
		<DIV>It's just over 2 months since I arrived back here and it's taken me a while to 
			re-acclimatise (the weather just keeps changing!), and adjust to how massively 
			expensive every thing's become (5 euro for a kilo of tomatoes, anyone?), and to 
			remember all the old kiwi words and slang and get used to the comments on my 
			'weird' accent.&nbsp;
		</DIV>
		<DIV>I've been&nbsp;a 'dole bludger', living&nbsp;that wonderful kiwi way of life 
			of receiving money from the government for doing absolutely nothing for 
			society. For about a year before I came back here I was dreaming about going on 
			the 'dole' (the unemployment benefit) and finally it's come true! Oh new 
			Zealand, land of dreams!</DIV>
		<DIV>&nbsp;I do have long term plans however, which involve a long period of rest 
			and relaxation and gardening e.t.c, and catching up with my friends and their 
			binge drinking ways (I'd forgotten what it's like to drink an entire bottle of 
			wine in a matter of hours and then go hunting around for more), and to try to 
			avoid getting involved again in their binge drinking ways....And then 
			eventually university, starting in March next year. I'm going to study 
			political science, Italian, English literature and philosophy and I'm very very 
			excited at the prospect of some structured, purposeful learning. Undoubtedly 
			the learning of travel can't be rivaled - it's so broad and general and all 
			encompassing - but it's quite hard to get down into the specifics of things and 
			explore one topic or subject in any detail. I think of the many philosophical 
			conversations and discussions had travelling, and&nbsp;the points and 
			conclusions we reached - but I have trouble explaining who Kant is and not much 
			of an idea what he was going on about.</DIV>
		<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
		<DIV>So physically my travels are over... there'll be no more overloaded backpacks 
			or stiff necks or stunning mind blowing boarder controls or situations of 
			panic. Sigh. But mentally&nbsp;they're not over and I'm very excited about what 
			the future in this little, green, backward but then so forward, beautiful 
			country holds.</DIV>
		<DIV>And you must come and visit 
			me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</DIV>
		<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
		<DIV>Lots of love and extended hugs,</DIV>
		<DIV>Melody</DIV>
