<p>Hello hello,<br>
guten tag, previat, dobry den,<br>
How is life continuing in your part of earth?</p>
<p>The computer is acting frivolous so I don't know if this will actually reach 
you/make sense, but I'll try...........</p>
<p>Thanks for the emails they have been so lovely, it's such a thrill to open my 
account and see a familiar name waiting with homely and exciting messages. I 
said I'd write more in detail, so here I am with another travel log, it's been a 
while; I've a few more stories to tell if you're interested to know what the 
bizarre world has been throwing at me in the last month or so.</p>
<p>Some of this may be repetitive, sorry, I think the last time I wrote I was in 
Kyiv, or Odessa in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Sadly I have since left that beautiful, enigmatic land, amidst much shedding 
of tears and many moving partings with the gentle, whimsical natives. It was a 
very memorable farewell - especially from Odessa, we had a great traditional 
Ukrainian night out with vodka and friends and Russian discotechs. My two months 
there had failed to prepare me for the brutal reality of just how much vodka the 
average Ukrainian really can consume, and they were intent on proving their 
strength and tolerance, and testing mine, which I happily admit is non existent. 
Thus it was a night of madness, people ran amok, I threw money away like a 
rampant millionaire, attempted to out drink the Russians, had a massive rumbling 
'discussion' with an American peace core worker who agreed with the current war, 
disappeared for an hour and worried everyone before i was found backstage 
interviewing several (hot) breakdancers, then we hitched home (very common thing 
to do in the cities there - you pay the driver a small fare) in a mafiaish 
Mercedes Benz and the driver decided to boy race our friend Denise, weaving and 
spinning all through the wide streets, whilst I hung out the window yelling 
obscenities in typical chummy New Zealand talk which strangely freaked out the 
Ukrainians.</p>
<p>A last few days in Kyiv saying goodbye to Joy the British pseudo-missionary, 
and the weird ex-pat community who'd accommodated me. On my last night I was 
unfortunate enough to see the Liverpool football team, under the lights of 
Republican Stadion as they played Kyiv Dynamo. There was a fantastic big raucous 
crowd of Ukrainians yelling and jumping, munching madly on sunflower seeds and 
sausages, spilling beer everywhere - and, a small contingent of Liverpool 
supporters, standing sombre and solemn, on their feet the whole time (used to 
terraces i believe.) It was wonderful watching the crowd and I was incredulous 
that I was actually enjoying a football game. Then the sorry time came and away 
a train started to take me, from that incredible nation which taught and 
transformed me so.</p>
<p>As a final stab I was detained at the border, a desperate last ditch attempt 
to extract money. The arrogant border 'officials' came up with some feeble, 
avant garde story about how i had extended my visa at the wrong place. I was a 
little worried because i had only a couple of hours to leave before my visa well 
and truly ran out at midnight, and then I would be at their complete mercy. So I 
ranted and raved and yelled and remained adamant that I had no money to give 
them and they eventually gave up, and quietly, sadly, let me go.</p>
<p>Next Slovakia was tossed at me, almost unbearably Western and overwhelming 
with it's electrical lighting, supermarkets and fast trams. It was a complete 
shock having everything run smoothly, to not be ostracised for being vegetarian, 
to more than occasionally be able to communicate with a local. I spent some 
weeks hitching about in this new land which proved to be a quaint, picturesque 
little place, meeting locals, wandering around prehistoric ruins, gazing at 
steeples, sampling local liqueurs, arguing the meaning of existence, on it went. 
One memorable day I spent hitching with a Buddhist monk, it was enlightening, 
especially when we were picked up by a couple of 80's style rockers, a man in 
leathers and a woman with bleached blond hair, who just turned around and gawked 
at us, shaking their faded heads in disbelief. The monk grinned at them 
intensely, staring into their eyes, and i gave them a foreign glare, just for 
fun. They let us out much earlier than we'd hoped. A week in Nitra staying with 
an American english teacher, a former peace core worker who'd just spent 2 years 
in Kyrgystan, living among Tartars, Kurds, Kyrgys and Uzbeks. A brief 
investigation into the Roma culture there, the majorly discriminated minority 
(?) of Slovakia, exciting things happening in Nitra with a Roma faculty in the 
university and many NGO projects. Then a mad week in Bratislava, funds were 
running so low I was forced to take drastic measures and convinced some students 
to sneak me into their dormitory for free accommodation. I had no idea what 
chaos would ensue, an entire week of drinking drinking deranged drinking, the 
true slovak student way. I was in a dorm of Physicists and Mathematicians to add 
a psychotic twist - and very exceptionally nice and interesting people - really 
one in a million types, with knowledge of many things esoteric, such as 
Brazilian jazz and advanced tea brewery. Amazing discussions and learning and 
friends for life.</p>
<p>I then made the mistake of heading to Vienna, and experienced the first mild 
culture shock of my life. I was horrified at the waste, excess and over 
indulgent luxury of everything and all around me. I wanted to go back east, to 
reality, for it seemed this was not - this was a warped and plasticised fake 
land of tourism and leisure; devoid of real people and true living. <br>
Everyone was hidden, hostile, so bored and broken by life, yet as a nation 
they'd suffered so little; it seemed they were disillusioned by the apparent 
nothingness of it all. The rabid city had one forte - the myriad art galleries 
and museums, which I explored for a day, Hundertwasser house and all his images 
of and ramblings about New Zealand, and some amazing works by my favourite 
artist Egon Schiele, then had enough and ran away south to Slovenija.<br>
<br>
I had a long but interesting hitch hike there. One stimulating ride with an 
orchestra conductor from Vienna, he was writing a book about the relationship 
between Art, Science and Religion, so we debated this for a while. Then he 
divulged he was also a member of the notorious Austria Freedom Party (the really 
right wing, almost neo-nazis with a bad reputation everywhere) and we argued 
about this a long time, he tried to tell me all the negativity about Hilder and 
the party is is simply destructive rumours spread by the socialist opposition to 
try and win the next election. &quot;We have no interest in what has happened in 
history, 50, 60 years ago, for example, with Hitler,&quot; was one of his most 
exciting and ambiguous quotes.<br>
<br>
Then to Ljublijana, with a big wise Slovenian who had travelled around Africa 
and used to hitch himself. He took me home to meet his family and to have some 
tea, and they were unbelievably nice, jolly slavs, who delightfully invited me to 
stay. So I lived there with these most traditional and beautiful natives, a jolly 
mother, wise father, two sons who drank a lot of pivo, and a boisterous dog. I'd 
longed to see this fabled city, and my expectations were exceeded - pretty, 
captivating, with a sense of togetherness most big cities lack. The natives even 
took me south out into the countryside to see the uncanny, abundant nature, so 
ill fitting for central europe. On my last day - and it was the beginning of 
November - thick puffy flakes descended from the sky and Alack it is snowing and 
soon the whole world is enveloped. I'd doubted Ljublijana could look any 
prettier but the image of it swirling and glittering in a snow storm is one that 
will always remain with me.</p>
<p>Back through Austria - eeeek- and then a ride with a trendy German reggae\ska 
band who miraculously took me 500kms all the way to Munich.<br>
<br>
Once more in homely familiar Munich, I sprang a grand surprise on my friends 
here and turned up unexpectedly at their opening exhibition night of the Burning 
man festival. It was all madness and surpise and excitement, a great night. So 
now I'm staying here a while, trying to learn German (my first sentence; Mein 
vater war ein zegan hert) and shall soon be forced back to Britian to seek work 
and shelter from this irresponsibly cold european winter.<br>
<br>
Whoa. And that's it, the end of my current adventures,that's the end of my 
excitement and rush of the new, the finish of my attempted delving into the 
eastern european physce. I hope you enjoyed my latest stories, I really look 
forward to prehaps getting replies, anyway I'll update you all again, when life 
becomes once more exciting.<br>
<br>
Lots of love,<br>
