<h1>Nixon lamping - Part deux.</h1>

<p>I spent the following week in the Public Records office of Northern Ireland, 
but didn't find many more clues. In the Griffith's Valuation there was a record 
of a James Nixon of the Tyrone area having rented land - a large farm, a couple 
of houses and an 'office' (outhouse) - from a landowner around 1850, but no 
proof that it was the same James and no exact address was given. I further 
checked a few kilometres of church records on microfiche and found many Anna and 
William Nixon's but none others with names I recognised. The Presbyterian church 
records were completely destroyed and the Church of Ireland records for the 
Gavaughy area contained all the members of the Nixon family I had met on my 
previous trip to Omagh but no further links. </p>
<p>However Hazel Coulter (nee Nixon) had invited me back to Omagh with plans for 
some further investigations. She said she knew of a church in the Newtonsaville 
area where all the Nixon's of Gavaughy had been buried. After studying James' 
death certificate we'd decided that the death had simply been registered in 
Sixmilecross, and he was not necessarily buried there. </p>
<p>So once more I headed west on a Sunday morning bus and arrived to meet Hazel 
after church. We drove south out of the town through winding fields and lanes to 
the Gavaughy area, and at the end of a long stone walled lane we found a small 
Nixon settlement where Hazel's cousin Francey lived.<br>
He and his family were lounging about outside their cottage in the rare Irish 
sun with dogs and children, but soon jumped up and engaged in a determined 
discussion about our possibly related past. <br>
On my previous trip I had told Hazel little scraps of what I could remember from 
various bits of Nixon folk lore, such as the story of William leaving Northern 
Ireland in 1890, jumping on a boat for New Zealand, and meeting his wife on that 
boat who also happened to be from Northern Ireland. (Daniel has since told me 
this may not be true.) <br>
In our discussion, Francey recalled a story his cousin had told him, ah it was 
while back now, of a young Nixon man who'd gotten on a boat to sail to some far 
off place - possibly NZ - and had met his sweetheart on that boat on the way 
over ; and was never heard from again, he added enigmatically. I said I'd heard 
this same story and we grew excited - Francey said it was too much of a 
coincidence to overlook, I mean after all how many people really were there 
leaving Northern Ireland at that time on boats, very few I suspect, he said. And 
the chances of meeting your future wife on a crowded ship at sea for months and 
months - huh, very little.<br>
Reaffirmed, we headed off to the Newtonsaville church, where Francey was sure 
James would be buried.</p>
<p>On the car ride further into the countryside the houses of various Nixon 
sisters and cousins were pointed out, large farm houses appearing affluent and 
proud. And strangely (for me,) all in very close proximaty to one another.<br>
<br>
And so we arrived in time at Church of Ireland, Newtownsaville. It was a large, 
grey stone building on a hill overlooking the townland of Garvaughy, spring 
coloured fields and gentle undulations of dark green, and trees. In the 
graveyard we found the Nixon corner, and there we identified, and rediscovered, 
many of the relations of Francey and Hazel. There were, as usual, many unmarked 
or unnamed graves in that corner, and these we pinned our hopes on. <br>
Off we went again, to find the reverend for the church, and check the hard copy 
records. These attained, we scoured pages and pages for mention of a James, or a 
John, or even a Someone James from 1878, but although the records predated his 
year of death, we found nothing. <br>
Skepticism was neigh once more, and I only meekly agreed that of course these 
records weren't complete - fires, great floods, raging bulls, and so on.<br>
<br>
The fun wasn't over however, as we continued on our quest, venturing through the 
towns of Fintona and somewhere else to Fivemiletown. Here we paid a visit to 
Pearl, another cousin who possessed a memory exceeding the greatness of an 
elephant's, I was told.<br>
Pearl welcomed us in to her cosy stone cottage, which dogs and children were 
again making merry. As we drank tea we discussed the whole feverishly mysterious 
case once more. Pearl seemed to know a lot, she brought up names of grandfathers 
and third cousins and, bizarrely, a not so distant relationship to George Best, 
(the Manchester United football player who has recently bought a new liver.)<br>
At Franceys mention of the man who went off on a boat to meet his wife on the 
way and never be heard of again, the lights dimmed and Pearl reclined in her 
chair. She began in hushed voice to tell us the story in full detail. Aye he was 
a fine man, so he was. A head of hair like fire, a thick mane that flowed after 
him as he walked, with his strong, slow gait........... When the story was over 
and I'd felt we'd spent enough time in reverential silence, I asked Pearl from 
which long dead soothsayer she had heard this story.<br>
&quot;Why Hazel of course - she told me the other day on the phone!&quot;<br>
<br>
Back in Omagh we discussed over dinner how most of our leads had fizzled off to 
their own conclusions. There were still a few churches which had not been 
checked, and more information could be added to the family trees, but my time in 
Northern Ireland was nearing an end and I felt there was not much more I could 
delve into.<br>
It had been fascinating nonetheless, to see the land where distant ancestors had 
lived for a couple of hundred years and moved on from, to get a sense of history 
and continuance from a place and feel somehow connected to the past, and to know 
that I would not exist if those people had not existed.<br>
So i said Goodbye to Hazel and Gavaughy and sixmilecross and headed off, not in 
a boat but a modern day Ulsterexpress bus, in which despite the appearance of 
many intriguing characters I did not, unsurprisingly, meet my future wife.</p>
