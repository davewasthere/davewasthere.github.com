  guedentag, gooten morgen das Müchen, Germany.<br>
  Hullo! how are you?<br>
  have you made it to Dubai yet?<br>
  well I äve finally left the dirty recesses of SCotland far behind and am 
  happily trapsing around the continent.<br>
  Ah it´s marvellous to be in good old Deustchland once again, I love this 
  country. <br>
  It´s so bizarre returning to a place though; after one year of contsant 
  unfamiliarity finally recognising places and meeting people for the second 
  time is an odd feeling - like an intense deja vu.<br>
  <br>
  I´m staying with Michy singi and stephan -really good friends from&nbsp;my last 
  visit here, who are lovely as can be, and have sorted out me somewhere to live 
  for free -&nbsp; a friends apartement- so i can stay here for as long as i want. 
  Otherwise those `youth hostels´ would drive me utterly insane after a 
  while-they are like huge barren army barracks, spartan and run like a prison 
  camp, -except without the government funding -so they charge exhorbitant 
  prices for the privliege of being poked awake in the dark of morning to&nbsp;be 
  force fed&nbsp;a cold breakfast of meat and brot.<br>
  Unfortunately I forgot my guide book, a bit foolish as i can´t find any 
  independent hostels.<br>
  <br>
  but nonetheless Müchen is wonderful - gloriously sunny and hot as usual - I´d 
  forgotten what it´s like to have something other than mist and fog pressing 
  down on you- and there are not too many tourists yet.<br>
  Last night I had dinner at Michy´s house with his family and it was very 
  German. We sat around wtih&nbsp;´HUge glasses of weiss beer and ate bread and 
  cheese and big slabs of meat, and that was all. They thundered away to each 
  other in German and i sat there and gawked.<br>
  Then I went with the guys to a reggae thing at a warehouse out of town and met 
  all the álternative´&nbsp; germans - if there is such a thing , as they´re all 
  pretty anti conformity these days. Very interesting people though - they´ve 
  got so much to say that´s worth hearing.(if I can actually understand any of 
  it- I´m slowly trying to learn&nbsp; ze Deusch.) But it´s a novel experience to 
  actually be able to have a decent conversation with someone when you´re out - 
  not just have them breathing drunkenly down your neck and rant and slobber 
  about how inebriated is their state.</p>
<p>
  Before that I was in Salzburg, Austria, which is a very beautiful country 
  overflowing with mountains and fortresses and onion shaped dome roofs and 
  people in peasant clothes singing on the hillsides merrily.<br>
  It´s incredible to be travelling again, getting so much stimulation and energy 
  and learning infinite amounts about thé world. so far the solo mission is 
  proving to be a good move, although I haven´t gone that hard core yet - the 
  test will be when I get to the non english speaking non english liking east. 
  can´t wait!<br>
  <br>
  well it just looks too inviting outside, so I think i will go and sit in a 
  biergarten or go to the park.<br>
  I hope everything is going well with you, and look forward to your reply, <br>
  lots of love, Melody</p>
