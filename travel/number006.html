<h2>Dave in Dubai</h2>
<p><strong><IMG height=350 src="images006/dubai.gif" width=350> </strong></p>
<p>Kia ora! Whakatau.<br>Me again. I've finally finished my 
latest update... Well, not quite true. I've finally stopped <em>amending</em> my latest update. Things keep happening at a 
rate too quick to keep up with. I've missed out heaps, but here is a few 
snippets of the latest happenings...</p>
<p><strong>Dubai, United Arab Emirates.</strong><br>
Well, I landed okay. No major problems 
there. I have decided I don't like travelling east though. My body <strong>likes</strong> travelling west. My&nbsp;body clock 
is always a couple of 
hours west of wherever I am, so travelling west makes sense. (That explains my tendencies 
to sleep in and stay up late. Or maybe that's just because I'm lazy?) It took me a 
couple of days to adjust here. Not helped by the fact that I still 
hadn't gotten over that flu I had in London. Dammit!<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Hotels on the Beach.<br></strong>After getting here, Will, Andy and I went for a bit 
of a cruise down and along the Beach for a bit of a look around. Nothing but 
palaces and hotels for miles along the beach. All of them have private beaches, 
and you (normally) have to be a guest to get access to 
the sand. Apparently the old ruler of Dubai wanted the beaches kept free for the public, but once 
he died his sons got into the Beach-Hotel Development market. Now you have to 
go a fair way to find a spot you don't have to pay for...<br>          
                  
              
             <br><IMG height=372 src="images006/jumeira_beach_hotel.jpg" width=668><br>The 
Jumeira Beach Tower hotel (left), and the Jumeira Beach hotel (right). The 
building on the right is <strong>BIG</strong> , yet it is 
dwarfed by the Jumeira Beach Tower hotel. The light show at night is 
particularly cheesy. (but worth a look) </p>
<p><strong>Golden Sands 7.<br></strong>The apartment we've got is not bad. Lovely big rooms, and the air-conditioning is a nice respite from the scorching heat outside. (although it is getting 
much cooler now winter is arriving, almost down to the high twenties!)<br> 
 My favourite feature of 
this place is the swimming pool on the roof. I've try to go for a swim&nbsp;most days. 
I love it.</p>
<p><strong>Quake-Fest.<br></strong>There was sort of a Quake-fest thing running here 
the first 'weekend' I got here. (My weekends being Thursday and Friday in the
UAE)<br>I signed up for a bit of a laugh, and finished 5th overall. 
Not a bad effort I reckon. I ended up winning some flash 32meg video card, which 
would be great, if only I had a PC to put it in. (May have to go out and buy 
one now) The other 9 guys in the final were all very good, so I 
was pretty chuffed to come fifth. There were only around 160 entrants in all, so it wasn't a huge 
event.</p>
<p><strong>Insane Taxi ride.<br></strong>Before I left London, I had the most amazing taxi 
ride. I think it qualifies for the ride from hell.<br>I had 
spent the night at The Syndrome (Some nightclub-type place out near Willesden Green)&nbsp;with <a href="http://www.aotea.org/john">John 
Harrison</a>    
          . 
After the place closed I had to find a way home. No Black cabs around, so it was 
mini-cab time. Anyway, I met this guy walking along the sidewalk and asked him 
where I could find a mini-cab. He said he was a mini-cab driver, so off we went 
to get his cab. We had to walk a <strong>long</strong> way, and he started 
telling me how somebody broke his window that night.<br>We get to his 
car, and sure enough, the passenger's window is broken. So I get in the back, 
and off we go to Hanger Lane. (home for me)<br>To be honest, he wasn't a bad 
driver. But he kept having these involuntary spasms which caused him to flick 
his head down until his chin touched his chest. (Not confidence 
inspiring)<br>We get to Hanger Lane roundabout, and the car stalls. He 
says "Sorry about this mister", and then restarts the car. I hadn't noticed 
until now that the ignition was hotwired. (Yes, it gets worse) I get him to stop 
outside McDonalds. (I'm not going to let him see where I live) then he tries to 
sell me an answer phone. Me, being particularly thick, ask 'what sort of answer phone?'. Then out of his jacket he pulls this
answer phone, and wants to 
know if I'll buy it for Â£10. Things are looking very suss', then he tells me if 
there is anything I want, he can get it.<br>Needless to say, I got out of there 
pretty damn quick.</p>
<p><strong>Driving around Dubai.<br></strong>And I thought Russian taxi drivers were bad 
enough! I still haven't found the brand of cereal that locals find their drivers-licenses in. My residence visa has 
come through, so after doing a visa run to Doha, I'm hoping 
to go get my Dubai licence soon. Unfortunately that means I'll also have to start driving 
like a maniac, with utter disregard for human life.<br>I've been driving around though (on my International licence), and 
it's been great. I'd gone for 6 months without driving at all (apart from once 
in London). So it was a real boost once I started here.<br>   
              
          Still, the benefits of independence, may 
be overrated as most drivers   
              
          here are attempting 
to kill everyone else, so the rest of the time I either taxi or walk.</p>
<p>  It's not really possible to walk around Dubai without 
hearing the mating-call of lurking taxis. Just because I'm white, and it's warm, 
they expect me to catch a taxi down to the shops. Go figure...  Then 
again, it's not typical to walk around here. It's difficult to cross the road 
(up to 6 lanes in a lot of places) as most drivers seem 
to accelerate when they see you crossing. (I must be worth 50 points or something)</p>
<p><strong>Would the real Mr David Peer please stand 
up.<br></strong>Nope, that's not a typo. I am Mr David Peer. In the Arab circles 
here I can't have the surname Beer, so I am officially know as Mr David Peer. 
I'm hoping it means I can get out of paying for all of Mr Peer's accounts. It 
obviously wasn't me. Look at my Passport!<br>(It's worth a try maybe... ...or not.)</p>
<p>Just don't try going to peer.net.nz or anything silly like that!</p>
<p><strong>London and Back<br></strong>Flew back to London for several reasons. Most importantly, I had tickets 
to the ABs vs Scotland up in Edinburgh, so it was essential to get back for that. (Or 
so I though)</p>
<p><strong>Those dratted All Blacks<br></strong>What a Hart-breaker! I went to two of the games 
with Mike, Brenda (plus a few others). A lack-lustre victory over Scotland, and 
our glorious defeat at the hands (and feet) of the French. Damn it! I've decided 
to have a personal ban on everything French for the next four years at 
least.<br>  
               
I thought the final was alright, but my best  
               
game of the tournament had to be the SA/Aussie game. I was totally 
on the edge of my seat!</p>
<p><strong>My new toy</strong><strong><br><IMG height=168 src="images006/dscf505.jpg" style="LEFT: 110px; 
TOP: 1301px" width=300><br></strong>I splashed out a little and bought myself a 
 digital camera. It was primarily due to my 
Pentax having a little problem with it's shutter curtain. To save myself ruining any more shots, I thought the digital method 
was a good way to go, so I bought myself a Sony Cybershot DSC-F505. 
It's a beast! 2.1 megapixel CCD, so it takes photos with a resolution 
of 1600x1200. And the quality is pretty astounding too. It looks a little weird, but I 
like it. It also takes short movies, but I haven't quite decided whether I 
like the&nbsp;5-60 second mpeg's yet or not. All of these photos are courtesy of this 
camera!</p>
<p><strong>Jet boating<br></strong><IMG height=229 src="images006/jet_boat_and_helicopter.jpg" width=638><br>I don't know what you 
think after looking at this picture, but I reckon the pilot is insane!</p>
<p>Jac, Will and I went out to watch the formula 1 jet boat racing while it was 
on out here. It was a bit of a laugh. When they were approaching us during the 
first lap, it was like a scene out of Apocalypse Now.<br><IMG height=113 src="images006/apocalypsenow.jpg" width=828></p>
<p><strong>The Dubai 2000 Air show<br></strong>This was a 
pretty cool event. Here I am not even 8 months out of the Air force, and I'm 
going to Air shows. Ha!<br>There was some pretty hi-tech equipment here. Had a good 
chat to one of the guys heading off to Next year's Fincastle competition (Anti 
Sub warfare jobbie) and we got a bit of a rundown on the current development 
going on with the Nimrods. (Interesting stuff if you are ex-firm)<br> I'm glad 
I finally got to see a Mig 29.&nbsp;It would have to be one of my all-time favourite 
aircraft.<br><br><IMG height=181 src="images006/f16_taxiing.jpg" width=730><br>         
              
            F-16 about to 
go out and do it's stuff. It was DAMN loud on 
takeoff.</p>
<p><IMG height=511 src="images006/mig29.jpg" width=786><br>A Russian MIG 29. 
The most gorgeous aircraft ever. (Although the SU-27 is pretty sexy too)</p>
<p><strong>The Dubai Rugby Sevens tournament<br></strong>YES! We won the Rugby 
Sevens. Awesome atmosphere. Drunk copious amounts of alcohol, and had a 
smashing time at the Bjorn-Again concert afterwards. Awesome to see Eric Rush 
and Dallas Seymour and a whole bunch of fullas I couldn't recognise!<br>They 
even posed for photos. Yours truly took a beauty! It would have been perfect, if 
only I'd taken the lens cap off. DOH!</p>
<p><IMG height=505 src="images006/guy_and_dave_at_rugby7s.jpg" width=458><br>Guy and Dave at the Bjorn-Again concert. Best photo I managed 
to take all day. No prizes for guessing which ABBA song is being played!</p>
<p><strong>I'm an Open Water Diver!<br></strong>I Went out 
and did my PADI course over the last couple of weeks. So now I am a qualified 
open water diver. I've dived some pretty interesting wrecks. There is the Port 
Rashid wrecks, which are a whole bunch of ships which were dumped to make a 
breakwater for the artificial harbour/docks. The cement barge, which sunk (I 
think during a storm) and all the sacks of cement are still on board. Quite 
solid now of course. And the V.C. Dara. One awesome big boat that the Captain 
took out into the gulf to weather out a storm. A mine exploded on board and 
caused a panic. 238 people abandoned ship and died, but everyone who stayed 
aboard survived. Unfortunately visibility was poor, but it was still a pretty 
wicked dive.</p>

<p>The only other dive, that I have done three times now, is the Relief reef. Tricky 
to navigate around, because my compass skills still aren't up to scratch (blame 
that on nitrogen narcosis) and I can't recognise any landmarks anywhere. Last 
time I dived the reef, there was this huge cloud of jelly fish which we swam 
through for probably&nbsp;five minutes before reaching clear water.&nbsp;Three of us got 
stung (me on the hand), but not badly. But there was no way of 
avoiding them. (Short of not diving)</p>

course).</p>
<p><strong>And now for some more photos:</strong></p>
<p><IMG height=320 src="images006/bracelets_in_gold_souk.jpg" width=569><br>A 
shop window from the Gold Souk. There is probably around a hundred jewellers in 
the Souk. (I didn't count them all though.)              
    </p>
<p><IMG height=396 src="images006/fulla_i_met_on_the_beach.jpg" width=528><br>Just some fulla I met out on the beach. He kindly posed for a 
shot. (pity about the rubbish)</p>
<p><IMG height=292 src="images006/mosque_from_air.jpg" width=486><br>There is a Mosque within walking distance, everywhere in the 
city. The plan 
(or is it a law) is to have no spot in Dubai that is 
further than 300m from the nearest Mosque. Something like London's plan to have pubs every 15 
metres... I took this shot during my visa run to Oman.</p>
<p><IMG height=499 src="images006/trip_out_on_hobiecat.jpg" width=413><br>More 
fun at the beach. I scored a sail of this Hobie Cat for about half an hour or 
so. It's a little odd to turn. Admittedly there wasn't much wind, and I had to use the 
tide to get the back end to turn around. But lotsa fun!</p>
<p><IMG height=328 src="images006/my_computer.jpg" width=406><br>My new work 
computer. Bit silly I know. But I'm pretty happy with it. It's the first 
Gigahertz processor machine I've ever used. (2 PIII 500MHz cpu's) Nice and 
quick. The 21" monitor helps a bit too. :-)</p>
<p>If you've got some 
spare time, go have a look at His Highness General Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al 
Maktoum's <a href="http://www.sheikhmohammed.com">website</a> . He is the ruler of Dubai. (also the Defence 
Minister for U.A.E.) It looks a little over the top, but is pretty restrained 
really. (Depends on your frame of reference)</p>
<p>That's it from me for now. I've got tons of work to do, and not much time to 
do it in. (Typical story)</p>
<p>Everyone have a fantastic Christmas and New Years. Me, I'm enjoying day 3 of 
Ramadan here in Dubai.<br>So until next time...</p>
<p>E&nbsp;noho ra (or Haere ra, I'm not sure which one applies with web site 
visitors...)</p>
