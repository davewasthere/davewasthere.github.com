        <h1>Things are always changing</h1>

<p><a href="/">Back Home</a></p>

<p>If there's one thing I've learnt about life, it's that things are always changing. 
    The only problem is, you sometimes find yourself in a place or a situation where 
    you really don&#39;t want things to change at all, but know they have to, or will at 
    some point. It&#39;s just one of those things you have to roll with I guess.</p>

<h2>Mum&#39;s back in Auckers</h2>
        <p>Was nice not to have to drive four hours north to see Mum this trip. Sure, I&#39;ll 
            miss Northland a bit. Especially Cooper&#39;s Beach fish and chips! But it&#39;s nice 
            having Mum and Ben in Auckland now. Especially after that hellaciously long 
            flight!</p>
        <p>It was Mum&#39;s 60th in January, so I took her to
            <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mckechnienurseries.co.nz/">McKechnie Nurseries</a> for some 
            native trees as her birthday present. Closest I&#39;ve seen her look like a kid in a 
            candy store. But take her to any craft shop and she&#39;ll do likewise.</p>
        <p>The plan is to plant as many natives around the new place as possible. The old 
            swimming pool has been removed and would be a great spot for a little fern 
            grotto. Looking forward to see the bush grow over the coming years.</p>
        <h2>My worldly possessions</h2>
        <p>With the move to the new place, it was time to take stock of what I had stored at 
            Mum&#39;s. Turns out, it wasn&#39;t a lot. A tent, some photos and papers, a little bit 
            of Air Force stuff and some sporting gear. Everything else has found it&#39;s way 
            into useful possession elsewhere over the past ten years. Although Mark still has a few of my books, 
            which I mostly read over the summer.</p>
        <h2>Getting creative again</h2>
        <p>Really enjoying trying my hand at various things this summer. Laid some 
            cobblestones, rewired a couple of motorbikes, making glass boxes, started 
            writing a bit more. My brother made half a chess set out of nuts and bolts, as 
            well as an amazing board, so I had to make the opposing half. Ended up brazing 
            pieces of bronze together with silver solder to create my pieces and was really 
            chuffed with how they turned out.</p>
        <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mDirCTkl.jpg" alt="The knight is always my favourite piece to make" width="428" height="640" /></p>
        <p>One of my favourite things was learning how to arc weld. I ended up making a name 
            plaque for someone I cared about. Was really chuffed with how it turned out.</p>
        <h2>Waiheke Island. Not just for hippies any more...</h2>
        <p>Finally got over to Waiheke, even if it was just for a couple of days. </p>
        <h2>Back to the UK</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Weekend in Wales</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>St Ives for the first time</h2>
        <p>I&#39;d never made it down any further than around Exeter way, but finally got down 
            to Land&#39;s End for a weekend when
            <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150549750215261.661824.721715260&amp;l=b8ef73c87c&amp;type=1">
            the three Daves went to St Ive&#39;s on holiday</a>. Dave E had been there 
            several times before, so we had some pretty good guidance around the place. Was 
            lovely and sunny, but definitely not quite warm enough yet. That said, still 
            jumped in the sea for as long as I could stand it. (Which wasn&#39;t terribly long)</p>
        <p>The Minack Theatre was amazing. And St Micheal&#39;s Mount? Just Wow!</p>

        <h2>Gym, Lido &amp; Triathlon training</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Need for a change</h2>
        <p>It&#39;s been an emotionally draining few months. One were your heart really goes 
            through the wringer and you wonder how you can get through the dark times. But 
            the one benefit from it all, is I found out that I&#39;m able to fall in love once 
            again. Sure, it </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Dave&#39;s first Triathlon</h2>
        <p>Bit nervous leading up to it. My swim was not bad, so I felt like I&#39;d be 
            competitive at that. And my run time wasn&#39;t horrendous. But I was particularly 
            worried after a ride with a couple of people from work. I&#39;d really struggled 
            keeping up with them</p>
