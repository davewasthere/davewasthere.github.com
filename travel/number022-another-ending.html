        <h2>Back to the Alps once more</h2>
        <p>After my trip in 2007, one of my mates at work got keen on motorcycling as well. 
            Kev hadn&#39;t ridden before, so he went through Direct Access and quickly got 
            himself sorted with a decent bike (A Susuki GSX600F). That meant it was time for another
            <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.248668340260.306751.721715260&amp;l=ab29a0a163&amp;type=1">
            blast around Europe</a>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;Our intention was to get down to the Alps, but we were attempting to avoid 
            the bad weather if we could. France and Belgium were lovely and toasty. If 
            anything, too hot! But once we got to Luxembourg, the weather turned. That meant 
            we really didn&#39;t enjoy Germany&#39;s Schwarzwald as much as we would have if the sun 
            had of stayed out.</p>
        <p>Three days of rain, followed by some more lovely sunshine while in the Swiss 
            Alps. Unfortunately, we&#39;d taken so long getting there, that there wasn&#39;t time to 
            go and explore more of the French Alps (which I love, and possibly prefer, even 
            if the roads aren&#39;t as immaculate as Switzerland&#39;s).</p>
        <p>Our last day, we did see a sobering site of one biker who&#39;d had a rather nasty 
            looking accident. I thought he looked pretty messed up, but Kev reckons he was 
            okay...&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope he was!</p>
        <p>My least favourite bit of the ride is that blast back when you&#39;re just trying to 
            make the tunnel/ferry. Since we didn&#39;t know what time, we hadn&#39;t booked ahead. 
            As it was, we managed to get separated somewhere around Nancy, so both made our 
            independent ways there. I stopped at Arras for some dinner and met another biker 
            who was just about to head off on another trip. I almost joined him, as the 
            weather looked like it was going to be spectacular from now on.</p>
        <p>Got to the tunnel entrance at Calais and they wanted some extortionate amount of 
            money for a passage. Think in excess of 100 Euros. Getting a return ticket was 
            about 75 Euros (and just not come back). But in the end, I got Liezl to book me 
            on online for the next morning for £30 and then went to the booth and asked 
            nicely if I could sneak on the next train... Think I had to pay an extra few 
            Euros for that, but well worth it in the end.</p>
        <p>Was a long long ride back. Met up with this guy who&#39;d been riding non-stop from 
            Poland and was going my way as far as Swindon, so we rode together. But once I 
            got home, I parked my bike and don&#39;t think I touched it again all year. Must 
            have been all biked out!</p>
        <h2>Liezl&#39;s Birthday trip to Corfu</h2>
        <p>Keeping in theme with our always trying to get away somewhere for our birthdays, 
            Liezl and I headed to Corfu in October. I&#39;d found this hotel that was rated 
            incredibly highly on TripAdvisor (love that site for holiday research) and it 
            looked really good value.</p>
        <p>October is pretty much shoulder season, so while the weather was nice and sunny 
            (and a good deal warmer than the UK) it was pretty quiet at Agios Stefanos. 
            Admittedly, it&#39;s not a massively touristy place in the first instance. We did 
            hire some bikes and rode over to Sidari. I&#39;ve got to say, what a complete and 
            utter shit-hole. X-Factor in every pub, just the typical Brit-abroad sort of 
            place. So glad we didn&#39;t end up somewhere like that. Sorry, just not for me.</p>
        <p>Enjoyed the swimming, but would have loved a little extra heat in the sun. And I 
            just love Greek food. Mmmmm....</p>
        <h2>Back down-under once more</h2>
        <p>Not keen on experiencing another UK winter, it was time to escape once more. This 
            time to Australia first.</p>
        <p>Neither of us had been to Sydney, although we almost got offloaded here back in 
            2003 after our visit to New Zealand when the place was almost too late to take 
            off. (Think there&#39;s a midnight curfew in Sydney)</p>
        <p>We stayed with my Uncle John and Robyn just on the north side of the harbour near 
            McMahon&#39;s Point. Was a lot of fun exploring Sydney. It&#39;s definitely a beautiful 
            city.</p>
        <p>Quite surreal to go swimming in a salt water pool right underneath that iconic 
            harbour bridge.</p>
        <p>Also managed to head out for a wine tour in Hunter Valley. I&#39;d hoped to find some 
            really good wines, but I&#39;ve been spoilt by French Reds. (And as a kiwi, I 
            probably should stick to whites from Aotearoa... they really are superb!)</p>
        <p>New 
            Years on the point watching the fireworks on the bridge was great! Huge crowds 
            and fairly well controlled by the Police. Fortunately we were inside the 
            residential area, so were allowed to go out onto the point. Otherwise we&#39;d have 
            not seen anything. They block most of the roads to limit how many people get 
            access to the waterfront.</p>
        <p>And then it&#39;s 2010!</p>
        <p>Headed up to Brisbane to spend a few days there before exploring some of the 
            Sunshine Coast. I&#39;m still undecided about Brisbane. Liezl&#39;s been in love with it 
            for ages, whereas I far prefer Melbourne. But I&#39;m willing to give it a chance at 
            least!</p>
        <p>Headed out west a little to catch up with my cousin Abel, who I hadn&#39;t seen for 
            maybe 15 years? He&#39;s got a lovely family and it was really neat to see him. +1 
            for Brisbane then. :-)</p>
        <p>Boring-arse drive up to the Sunshine Coast. Not that the scenery isn&#39;t gorgeous 
            or anything. The weather was fantastic and I really shouldn&#39;t complain. But the 
            speed limits feel <strong><em>so incredibly slow</em></strong>! I think that&#39;s 
            something I&#39;d struggle with living here. I&#39;m all for driving to the conditions, 
            but the Aussies and Kiwis take speed enforcement to ridiculous extremes. 
            Admittedly, they&#39;re probably the worst drivers in the western world, so maybe 
            there is some reason behind it...&nbsp; But I don&#39;t think the statistics support 
            the legislation. Europe&#39;s approach seems far more pragmatic.</p>
        <p>I loved Coolum! Miles and miles of beach!</p>
        <p>Went for a run early one overcast morning - and next thing I know, I&#39;m burnt. 
            Forgot how bloody lethal the UV is here. Glad it wasn&#39;t anything past a mild 
            pink tinge. Could have been very nasty. I really need to watch my skin!</p>
        <p>The surf was great, only the jellyfish detracted from the fun. Sounds like the 
            water is so warm here, that you get jellyfish for more months of the year. 
            Shame, but not a deal breaker. I honestly felt like I could be happy renting a 
            place here for a while. Seemed very chilled.</p>
        <p>One of my favourite features was the free barbeques on the beach. That made life 
            pretty nice I can tell you.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, in the midst of all this sunshine, food, sea and sand, Liezl and I 
            called it a day on our relationship. She still came with me to New Zealand, but 
            it was over. We had given it another try, but some of the same problems persist. Such 
            is life.</p>
