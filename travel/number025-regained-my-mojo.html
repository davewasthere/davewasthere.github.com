        <h1>Lost my mojo</h1>

<p><a href="/">Back Home</a></p>

<p>The past year had been a bit of a bummer. Had some highs, but also some epic lows as well. Now that&#39;s not normal for me, so it was time for some travel-therapy since I&#39;m not so keen on shopping. The light at the end of a very long and very dark tunnel, was a dive trip to Belize with Crystal.</p>
        <h2>La Isla Bonita</h2>
        <p>I&#39;d met Crystal at <a href="/travel/number019-best-summer-ever.html">Mike &amp; 
            Brenda&#39;s wedding</a> back in 2008. We&#39;d spent a couple of weeks after the 
            wedding travelling around NZ, diving at Tutukaka &amp; just generally seeing the 
            sights up and down the country. I knew we made good travel buddies, so when she 
            suggested a dive trip to Belize I was well up for it.</p>
        <p>Was a little concerned that the weather would be rubbish after seeing a downpour at 
            Miami. But upon arrival, Belize was baking hot and the sun was out in full force. There were 
            two ways to get out to the island from Belize. Since I was arriving first, and was in no 
            hurry, I ended up taking the speedboat out to the island. We did end up powering through a bit of rain on the way out to San Pedro, but it wasn&#39;t too bad. Made 
            friends with a little local boy during the trip who was travelling with his 
            parents and sister. No common language between us, but we were both happily 
            playing various games and time flew by.</p>
        <p>Arriving at Grand Caribe the apartment was amazing. I&#39;m normally quite a budget 
            traveller, not really seeing much value in splashing out too much for a bed, so 
            this was well outside my comfort zone. But man, was it nice!</p>
        <p>Basically, we spend two weeks just swimming, eating, drinking, diving and 
            wandering around the island. It was a much needed period of bliss. Met some very cool people throughout and I&#39;ve got nothing but fond memories of the trip. My only regret is the weather on the mainland was so horrible that we elected not to go exploring some of the Mayan ruins. That&#39;s something I would have been very keen on!</p>
        <h2>Dave&#39;s Mid-life Crisis Tour</h2>
        <p>My usual summer-down-under turned into something else this year. For once, I&#39;ve 
            got absolutely no plans for the future. Last year had sort of shaken them up a 
            little and I was probably still licking my wounds a little. So I&#39;ve stuck to my 
            tried and tested escape to the Southern Hemisphere and we&#39;ll see what 
            opportunities life brings. Something always happens 
            along when you need it to. My intention was to spend this year travelling, 
            maybe. Actually, I had no idea. But I was aware I am about to turn 40, so wanted 
            to do something...&nbsp; I had a few ideas, but nothing concrete.</p>
        <h3>Part Un - New Zealand</h3>
        <p>Being back home was wonderful. Spent some time at Mum&#39;s getting a little bit 
            crafty. Actually got into a little bit of sewing, making badges on the 
            overlocker. I was particularly proud of my kiwi roundell I made for my man-bag.</p>
        <p>Spent some time with Hari, Todd and the girls. Helped Todd invesigate a truck 
            rollover down the line which was pretty cool. It mostly involved surveying the 
            scene and inspecting the vehicle &amp; trailer, but was a nice change from geeking 
            out on the laptop. Speaking of laptops, I managed to stand on mine accidentally, 
            so the screen stopped working. So I&#39;ll have to look for a new one, which is a 
            bit of a bugger, as I loved my little Samsung.</p>
        <p>Sadly, Nana passed away, not quite making it to Christmas. It&#39;s kind of bitter-sweet to see all the family for occasions like a funeral. But it was one way to see people that I don&#39;t ordinarily get a chance to catch up with.</p>
        <p>Spent a little bit of time in Welly, </p>
        <p>Mangawhai Heads</p>
        <p>Some plans</p>
        <h3>Part Deux - Australia</h3>
        <p>Went to Sydney to stay with Pia for a couple of weeks before heading to Thailand. 
            I&#39;d met her and her Mum at Mount Maungonui when I was passing through and we&#39;d 
            met up a couple of times, but she&#39;d since moved to Aussie with work and had 
            invited me to go visit.</p>
        <p>While I was in town, I went and chatted to a local startup involved in the 
            ticketing space. My work on ticketing applications could come in handy and they 
            needed a website rewrite, so we talked about a potential partnership. In the end 
            I got another offer that I couldn&#39;t turn down, but would have loved to have worked with them... Will just have to see how things go...</p>
        <p>I really enjoyed Sydney and while I preferred Melbourne, I could see myself living here. But I can probably see myself living everywhere.</p>
        <h3>Part Trois - Thailand</h3>
        <p>After Sydney though was Thailand... and wow! Bangkok was busy. I&#39;m not sure I was ready for it to be honest. Such an 
            assault on the senses.</p>
        <p>Thailand was just a temporary stop. I&#39;d been able to change my flights so I 
            stopped over here, but it was just so I could get to Vietnam. Fortunately, I did 
            have a couple of weeks to check the place out. But after a couple of days, I&#39;d 
            had enough of Bangkok and wanted some beach action.</p>
        <p>I&#39;d been recommended the bus down to Koh Samui, so I ended up buying a slightly 
            overpriced ticket and heading south. The bus was possibly the worst journey I&#39;ve 
            ever made, and that&#39;s saying something. Avoid at all costs! Definitely better to 
            fly or catch the train.</p>
        <p>Koh Samui is a pretty neat little island. But I stayed in the South-east part of 
            the island and found the area a little seedy. Too many old, fat, balding white 
            guys with young local girls. Kind of gross. So I headed out of town and found a nice 
            deserted beach to go swimming. While there, I met this neat Irish fulla called 
            Rob, who was pretty much in the same boat. He wasn&#39;t really enjoying where we 
            were staying for the same reasons. Ended up having a few drinks that evening, 
            and decided to do a runner to another island to see if it was any better.</p>
        <p>Found the ferry after a bit of a frantic ride and managed to catch it with only a 
            few minutes to spare. I ended up just leaving my motorbike parked in the car 
            park. Fingers crossed it&#39;ll still be there when I get back. A couple hours later we were in Koh Tao. Met a really neat German guy called Alex 
            who&#39;d just spent 10 days in a slient retreat on Koh Pha Nang. Had to respect him 
            for that.</p>
        <p>Koh Tao is pretty much dive capital, so I managed to get a couple of dives in. Otherwise spent most the time exploring the island by foot or by bike. Definitely had a much better vibe than Koh Samui and I&#39;d go back any day. One regret is I didn&#39;t manage to do the free-diving course. Unfortunately it was a two day thing and I&#39;d not be able to go and do a SCUBA if I did the course. But that&#39;s another thing on the bucket list.</p>
        <h3>Part Quatre - Vietnam</h3>
